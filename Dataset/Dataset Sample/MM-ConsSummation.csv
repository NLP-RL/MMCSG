00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,790
how do I appreciate your participation

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,620
intake so far

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,600
want to change to a new section that's

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,970
okay with you and this section is on

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,360
substance use is that an area you feel

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,160
comfortable discussing it sure so are

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,490
there any substances that you currently

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,559
use um I drink a bit you tell me how

9
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,710
often you drink I guess it's it's more

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,960
than a bit I I would say I have probably

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,510
three drinks today and what do you drink

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,250
um beer dinner with sighs um the bottle

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,190
said there's there 63 bottles of beer a

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,150
day yeah

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,430
and how much time does it take you to

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,070
consider those probably a couple of

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,130
hours so every day three beers and about

18
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,700
two hours yeah does that do anything to

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,760
you in terms of your move huh it just

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,240
kind of helps me unwind after a long day

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,670
of work relaxes me that's relaxing for

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,300
you yeah has it ever gotten you into any

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,510
type of trouble huh there was a long

24
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,040
time that I my my friends and I kind of

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,390
got into a fight after I had been

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,920
drinking and we almost stopped talking

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,640
because of it but we were able to work

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,250
it out I almost lost friends over it

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,490
before all right is there any other

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,140
areas where it might disrupt functioning

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,090
sometimes it's hard to get up and get to

32
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,790
work the next morning after I've had if

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,880
I drink it like later in the day it's

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,990
how to get up and get to work on time

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,190
the next morning so I've been late a

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,710
couple of times too so three three

37
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,440
bottles of beer pretty much every day

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,390
pretty much every day much every day as

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,750
there ever been a time when you've

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,910
consumed more or less a particular day

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,700
um not typically during the week but I

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,050
well somehow they'll drink more on the

43
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,970
weekends maybe drink like my normal like

44
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,800
three in a couple of hours and then

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,560
maybe three three or four hours later

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,030
I'll have more you have a few more yeah

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,170
and how long have you been drinking I

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,570
guess I started when I was around 17 17

49
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,660
yeah was now you mentioned beer

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,540
have you ever consumed any other type of

51
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,200
alcohol

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,920
I've tried wine and shots before but I

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,780
always kind of just gravitate more

54
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,510
towards the air back towards ya any

55
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,489
other substances that you use currently

56
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,800
um uh on the weekends there as well all

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,810
I'll smoke some pot with my friends like

58
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,270
Saturday night

59
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,170
that's pretty much this weekend's um

60
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,660
sometimes during the week but before I

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,250
go to sleep I'll have a joint just it

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,480
helps my anxiety of my worries before I

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,260
go to bed when did you first start using

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,090
marijuana uh that was probably a couple

65
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,270
years ago when I first started college

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,570
about two years ago yeah and on the

67
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,120
weekends sometimes other times yeah um

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,100
actually I guess it's it's more on the

69
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,500
weekends that I'd say maybe every other

70
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,770
day during the week so nicely on the

71
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,810
weekends occasionally during the week

72
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,290
has it ever led to any trouble or change

73
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,209
to functioning um Matt I mean on the

74
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,310
weekends no because I don't really have

75
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,450
anywhere to be but um sometimes during

76
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,000
the week if I if I again I'm kind of

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,710
like that qualified smoking too late

78
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,240
again it's hard to get up in the morning

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,690
and get to work on time and my boss is

80
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,280
really starting to get irritated with me

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,740
how often I've been late not that I'm

82
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,400
like super late but I'm late enough have

83
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,220
you ever tried to cut down on the

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,300
substance use um I tried to cut back on

85
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,690
the alcohol before

86
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,380
about a year ago I try I was look

87
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,140
started when I started this job that I

88
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,180
have now I tried to come back when I

89
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,660
first started and I was able to get down

90
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,410
to like two one or two beers instead of

91
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,900
three

92
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,610
but then the job got stressful and I got

93
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,220
comfortable I guess and started drinking

94
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,880
more again

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,420
so you think perhaps the use is

96
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,910
connected to the stress with your job uh

97
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,530
yeah I would say it's definitely

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,200
connected all right have you ever been

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,840
annoyed by people that he perhaps

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,560
criticized your substance use yeah my

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
family can be critical of they don't

102
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,140
really know about the marijuana but they

103
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,540
can be critical of my alcohol use and

104
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,230
that bothers you yeah

105
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,360
have you ever felt bad or guilty about

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,550
your substance use right I felt guilty

107
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,440
with my mom because it upsets her so

108
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,450
much sometimes like I'll feel guilty

109
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,030
about how my substance abuse upsets her

110
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,020
but and sometimes I feel bad like if I

111
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,580
have a fight with my friends if I'm not

112
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,250
calm I'll feel bad the next day about

113
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,420
getting into an argument with them

114
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,920
because usually over something silly

115
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,880
have you ever had to drink or use drugs

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,060
first thing in the morning to study your

117
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,880
nerves or to lessen the effects of

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,150
hanging out um I'd say on the not during

119
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,650
the week but on the weekends when I'll

120
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,360
drink a little bit more sometimes I'll

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,470
have like us just a little bit like if I

122
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,700
drink Saturday night I'll have a little

123
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,060
bit Sunday morning to just get going so

124
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,890
on occasion that happens yeah I wouldn't

125
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,880
say it's often but on occasion so

126
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,090
alcohol marijuana two substances you

127
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,890
currently use you can't tell me about

128
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,660
substances you used in the past

129
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,680
um at a party one time I tried ecstasy

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,040
but I I didn't like it and I ended up

131
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,180
not really hanging out with those people

132
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,570
anymore so it it wasn't an issue for

133
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,370
just the one time yeah just the one time

134
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,140
all right

135
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,220
in high school my friends um a lot of my

136
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,710
friends were smokers so I smoke

137
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,900
cigarettes but kinda it just made me

138
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
feel sick and I really like you very

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,740
much you didn't really do anything for

140
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,130
me

141
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:29,960
so that didn't she discontinued yeah any

142
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,030
other substances or just those two um

143
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,890
just those two that I'm currently using

144
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,640
and then just the smoking and the

145
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,020
ecstasy all right do you have a family

146
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,480
history of substance use uh my

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,410
grandfather um my mom claims that my

148
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,060
grandmother was an alcoholic any other

149
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,400
history no not that I'm aware of at

150
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,580
least

151
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,230
before I move to the next section of the

152
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,780
intake while we're still talking about

153
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,000
substance use is there anything else you

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
want to add and their comments you want

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,580
to make about this section I don't think

156
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,080
so I think that covers it that covered

157
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,680
pretty well yeah I appreciate you

158
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,240

159
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,430
okay I'm going to move from this section

160
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,500
and move to the next section the intake","how do I appreciate your participation

intake so far

okay with you and this section is on

substance use is that an area you feel

comfortable discussing it sure so are

there any substances that you currently

often you drink I guess it's it's more

than a bit I I would say I have probably

three drinks today and what do you drink

um beer dinner with sighs um the bottle

day yeah

and how much time does it take you to

consider those probably a couple of

hours so every day three beers and about

two hours yeah does that do anything to

you in terms of your move huh it just

kind of helps me unwind after a long day

of work relaxes me that's relaxing for

you yeah has it ever gotten you into any

type of trouble huh there was a long

time that I my my friends and I kind of

got into a fight after I had been

drinking and we almost stopped talking

because of it but we were able to work

it out I almost lost friends over it

before all right is there any other

areas where it might disrupt functioning

sometimes it's hard to get up and get to

work the next morning after I've had if

I drink it like later in the day it's

how to get up and get to work on time

the next morning so I've been late a

started when I started this job that I

have now I tried to come back when I

first started and I was able to get down

to like two one or two beers instead of

three

but then the job got stressful and I got

comfortable I guess and started drinking

more again

so you think perhaps the use is

connected to the stress with your job uh

yeah I would say it's definitely

connected all right have you ever been

annoyed by people that he perhaps

criticized your substance use yeah my

family can be critical of they don't

really know about the marijuana but they

can be critical of my alcohol use and

that bothers you yeah

have you ever felt bad or guilty about

your substance use right I felt guilty

with my mom because it upsets her so

much sometimes like I'll feel guilty

about how my substance abuse upsets her

but and sometimes I feel bad like if I

have a fight with my friends if I'm not

calm I'll feel bad the next day about

getting into an argument with them

because usually over something silly

have you ever had to drink or use drugs

first thing in the morning to study your

nerves or to lessen the effects of

hanging out um I'd say on the not during

the week but on the weekends when I'll

drink a little bit more sometimes I'll

have like us just a little bit like if I

drink Saturday night I'll have a little

bit Sunday morning to just get going so

on occasion that happens yeah I wouldn't

say it's often but on occasion so

alcohol marijuana two substances you

currently use you can't tell me about

substances you used in the past

um at a party one time I tried ecstasy

but I I didn't like it and I ended up

not really hanging out with those people

anymore so it it wasn't an issue for

just the one time yeah just the one time

all right

in high school my friends um a lot of my

friends were smokers so I smoke

cigarettes but kinda it just made me

feel sick and I really like you very

much you didn't really do anything for

me

so that didn't she discontinued yeah any

other substances or just those two um

just those two that I'm currently using

and then just the smoking and the

ecstasy all right do you have a family

history of substance use uh my

grandfather um my mom claims that my

grandmother was an alcoholic any other

history no not that I'm aware of at

least

before I move to the next section of the

intake while we're still talking about

substance use is there anything else you

want to add and their comments you want

to make about this section I don't think

so I think that covers it that covered

pretty well yeah I appreciate you

answering these questions and if you're

okay I'm going to move from this section

and move to the next section the intake

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,800
afternoon Lily I'm glad you could make

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,580
it in today but I came here how would

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,550
you leap in so far I'm still a little

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,219
bit anxious yes last week when you were

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,170
and you were telling me that you were

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,990
experiencing great anxiety and we had

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,380
developed a plan a plan for your anxiety

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:31,789
and according to my notes you were going

9
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,150
to look into some yoga classes you were

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,900
going to attempt to drink less coffee

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,460
you were going to get out more with

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,449
people because you were kind of

13
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,519
isolating yourself in the home and you

14
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:48,519
were going to spend more time in nature

15
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:52,699
so I'm wondering how all that went well

16
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,610
I looked at the gym and there weren't

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,739
really any yoga classes so I didn't I

18
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,960
didn't really do that I did cut back on

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,780
my coffee a little bit but I just find

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,490
that it wakes me up in the morning so

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,920
you know I've cut back to one cup

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,850
instead of two cups and I did take the

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,549
dog for a walk but I haven't really

24
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,700
gotten out other than that okay so it

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,920
sounds like you've made some movement

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,030
forward towards your goals you did at

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,700
least look into yoga even though the gym

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,789
didn't have yoga classes you did cut

29
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:37,609
down from two cups of coffee to one and

30
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:42,289
you did get out with your dog in nature

31
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,219
for a walk but it sounds like you had a

32
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,950
little bit of an issue getting out more

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,319
with people yeah I don't I don't really

34
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,090
like to go out with people there's

35
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,009
usually a lot a lot of chatter a lot of

36
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,200
talking and it's hard for me to be in

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,899
there so it's uncomfortable for you to

38
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,499
be out around people with all the

39
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,240
speaking and chatting and talking and

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,850
how does that make

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,449
feel um it just makes me feel a little

42
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,060
bit nervous and then when I get out

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,100
there don't really I don't really engage

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,580
in conversation okay so actually getting

45
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,709
out with people actually makes you even

46
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,530
more anxious so I'm wondering what we

47
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,430
could do about that um I'm not really

48
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,319
sure maybe I could invite people over

49
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,550
instead that would absolutely be one

50
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,920
option you could invite people over to

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,200
your house and then you could get to

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,870
choose who you're around yeah it's a

53
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:47,319
good idea and in terms of the the yoga

54
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,220
let's get back to the yoga format tell

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,560
me more about where you looked for yoga

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,410
classes well I just looked at my gym I

57
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,470
didn't really look anywhere else because

58
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,299
I'm already paying to go to a gym and I

59
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,880
don't really want to pay extra to go

60
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,799
somewhere else so that's why I didn't

61
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,950
really look anywhere else mm-hmm and so

62
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,630
if I were to ask you right now how

63
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,400
motivated are you to find a yoga class

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,870
on a scale of one to ten maybe about a

65
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,650
five or six okay and so what made you

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,359
say five or six rather than two or three

67
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,709
um well I I see all these pictures in my

68
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,549
newsfeed about yoga and I see all these

69
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,070
pictures and I just want to do it so I'm

70
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,750
interested in doing it it's just really

71
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,620
hard so when you see the pictures on

72
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,079
your newsfeed it makes you excited about

73
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,350
doing it but when you actually go to do

74
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,590
it it makes it yeah more challenging

75
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,190
well it's it I haven't done it before so

76
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,600
it's a little bit hard to get out there

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,130
because I don't think I'm as flexible as

78
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,840
the other people mm-hmm

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,730
and so you're thinking that you're not

80
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,640
as flexible as the other people I'm

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,440
wondering if that's what yoga is about

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,500
civility well I think I think that

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,530
people go to become flexible but I think

84
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,209
that maybe some people are already just

85
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,779
flexible mm-hmm so you are concerned

86
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,240
that maybe you might not be as flexible

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,790
as the rest yeah and you'd be a beginner

88
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,920
well I'm worried I wouldn't be able to

89
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,300
do the poses in class

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,910
okay so what do you think would happen

91
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,230
if you couldn't do the poses in class

92
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,890
well I I feel embarrassed I think and

93
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,810
then if the teacher tried to get me to

94
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,610
do it and everybody else would see that

95
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,860
they're trying to get me into a pose and

96
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,520
I think it would be embarrassing okay so

97
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,230
you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do

98
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,190
the certain poses and how would you feel

99
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,100
if you could do all the poses in the

100
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,760
class

101
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,960
well I think I feel really good and so

102
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,480
what do you think it is preventing you

103
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,810
from not doing all the poses in the

104
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,450
class why I guess it's just the

105
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,050
embarrassment of maybe not being able to

106
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,919
do it what what would cause you to not

107
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,320
be able to do it with the closest or not

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,780
I'm not sure okay

109
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,930
I remember when you first came in last

110
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,170
week you told me that when you were

111
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,630
younger you used to be very very

112
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,010
flexible and I'm wondering what would

113
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,070
make that difference between then and

114
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,900
now well when I was a kid I used to just

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,540
practice a stretch a lot and now that I

116
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,490
don't I don't have that same flexibility

117
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,100
mm-hmm so as I've gotten older I've lost

118
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,840
a lot of flexibility and how would it be

119
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,090
if you couldn't do all the poses in the

120
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,130
class and you did get embarrassed and

121
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,590
you just let it be embarrassed I mean it

122
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,500
would be okay but I don't I don't like

123
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,830
that feeling what would be the payoff do

124
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,740
you think if you put up with a little

125
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,860
bit of embarrassment well I probably

126
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,610
feel we're not a good in the end you

127
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,470
know I can give you a lots of studies

128
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,860
that I can give you and videos that I

129
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,890
can show you of people that started yoga

130
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,500
and started practicing yoga and their

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,660
anxiety went way down as a matter of

132
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,410
fact some studies show that anxiety

133
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,100
doing yoga can be decreased the same as

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,950
medications so I'm not sure if you were

135
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,550
if you knew that or not I didn't really

136
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,580
know that I just thought that that yoga

137
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,650
was more about flexibility I didn't

138
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,640
realize there were so many other

139
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,330
benefits okay so how motivated would

140
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,460
that make you feel on a scale of one to

141
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,020
ten well I probably if I thought that

142
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,940
I'd be it would make me less anxious I

143
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,800
think I'd probably be around an eight or

144
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,650
nine good good

145
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,780
that's a definite improvement and and

146
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,940
you could determine after that first

147
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,670
class whether you're

148
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,960
levels have decreased or not and that

149
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,010
would that be validation for you or

150
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,310
would that be you give you even more

151
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,220
motivation if your anxiety levels were

152
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,680
decreased instantly after the yoga class

153
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,300
I think that would be a lot of

154
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,280
motivation okay to continue so one other

155
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,450
thing that I wanted to to mention to you

156
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,150
um was you said that you'd walk your dog

157
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,850
in nature and I'm curious as to how much

158
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,070
time did you spend walking your dog in

159
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,110
nature wow it was only about 30 minutes

160
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,820
it was really cold and windy so we

161
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,950
didn't want to stay out and by we I mean

162
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,750
the dog and I mmm-hmm

163
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,470
and so because of it was cold and Wendy

164
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,750
you decided to kind of cut the walk

165
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,190
short yeah

166
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,100
and and that's definitely understandable

167
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm wondering what you could do to

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,430
possibly get an hour of walking the dog

169
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,080
in a day Wow it might help if I take a

170
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,960
jacket next time okay so if you took a

171
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,070
check in case it's gold yeah and do you

172
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,350
have a special place in nature that

173
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,780
makes you feel peaceful that you could

174
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,190
be and that would help you even more

175
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,020
enjoy it as long as I'm just away from

176
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,230
road noise and traffic and then it's a

177
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,540
lot better okay and there's lots of

178
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,120
trails around my house like that okay

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,680
excellent it's great that you have

180
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,510
trails around your house where you're

181
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,100
not exposed to all that noise and so do

182
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,550
you think you could commit to an hour

183
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,760
probably and on a scale of one to ten

184
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,990
tell me what that probably means um it's

185
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,070
probably a ten I can I can

186
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,520
to that okay all right so it sounds like

187
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,250
last week you had a few problems

188
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,100
carrying out play assignments towards

189
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,440
decreasing your anxiety you really

190
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,180
couldn't find a yoga class because

191
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,980
you're already signed up for a gym that

192
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,560
doesn't have the yoga classes but you

193
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,140
you already know about the yoga videos

194
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,030
that I've sent you so you could actually

195
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,980
do them at home how strongly do you feel

196
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,120
about doing them at home if I could do

197
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,430
them at home I would probably do them

198
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,520
all the time mm-hmm I think that would

199
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,620
be a big difference and then there would

200
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,570
be no embarrassment factor if you

201
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,620
couldn't do the poses less coffee you've

202
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,900
gone from two cups to one cup that's

203
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,950
very good and get out more with people

204
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,410
you've decided to invite people over to

205
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,780
your house rather than going out with

206
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,550
other people not knowing who's going to

207
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,450
be in your space that's always an

208
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,580
apprehensive moment when you don't know

209
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,410
you have no control over who's going to

210
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,230
be in your space and on a scale of one

211
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,090
to ten you think that you could spend at

212
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,530
least an hour a day walking with the dog

213
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,860
job I think we have a plan

214
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,190
so overall on all four of these items

215
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,580
how motivated do you feel on a scale of

216
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,060
one to ten I think it's a 10 I think I

217
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,800
can do them on all four all four

218
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,090
fabulous and how do you think you will

219
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,190
feel if you were to envision how you

220
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,360
would feel incorporating all of these

221
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,930
items in your life next week of the

222
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,110
course of next week how much of a

223
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,400
difference do you think it would make

224
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,940
you feel I think it but maybe even make

225
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,030
me look forward to doing these

226
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,890
if I were doing them on a regular basis

227
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,400
mm-hmm and how would it make you feel I

228
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,020
think it would make me feel really good

229
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,710
and so you feel relaxed and you would

230
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,810
feel more positive and I think you would

231
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,150
- very good thank you

232
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,280
we'll check in next week we'll make an

233
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,600
appointment for next week and catch up

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,730
and see how you're doing with all this

235
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,710
good job thank you so much","afternoon Lily I'm glad you could make

it in today but I came here how would

you leap in so far I'm still a little

bit anxious yes last week when you were

and you were telling me that you were

experiencing great anxiety and we had

developed a plan a plan for your anxiety

and according to my notes you were going

to look into some yoga classes you were

going to attempt to drink less coffee

you were going to get out more with

people because you were kind of

isolating yourself in the home and you

were going to spend more time in nature

so I'm wondering how all that went well

I looked at the gym and there weren't

really any yoga classes so I didn't I

didn't really do that I did cut back on

my coffee a little bit but I just find

that it wakes me up in the morning so

you know I've cut back to one cup

instead of two cups and I did take the

dog for a walk but I haven't really

gotten out other than that okay so it

sounds like you've made some movement

forward towards your goals you did at

least look into yoga even though the gym

didn't have yoga classes you did cut

down from two cups of coffee to one and

you did get out with your dog in nature

for a walk but it sounds like you had a

little bit of an issue getting out more

with people yeah I don't I don't really

like to go out with people there's

usually a lot a lot of chatter a lot of

talking and it's hard for me to be in

there so it's uncomfortable for you to

be out around people with all the

speaking and chatting and talking and

how does that make

feel um it just makes me feel a little

bit nervous and then when I get out

there don't really I don't really engage

in conversation okay so actually getting

out with people actually makes you even

more anxious so I'm wondering what we

could do about that um I'm not really

sure maybe I could invite people over

instead that would absolutely be one

option you could invite people over to

your house and then you could get to

choose who you're around yeah it's a

good idea and in terms of the the yoga

let's get back to the yoga format tell

me more about where you looked for yoga

classes well I just looked at my gym I

didn't really look anywhere else because

I'm already paying to go to a gym and I

don't really want to pay extra to go

somewhere else so that's why I didn't

really look anywhere else mm-hmm and so

if I were to ask you right now how

motivated are you to find a yoga class

on a scale of one to ten maybe about a

five or six okay and so what made you

say five or six rather than two or three

um well I I see all these pictures in my

newsfeed about yoga and I see all these

pictures and I just want to do it so I'm

interested in doing it it's just really

hard so when you see the pictures on

your newsfeed it makes you excited about

doing it but when you actually go to do

it it makes it yeah more challenging

well it's it I haven't done it before so

it's a little bit hard to get out there

because I don't think I'm as flexible as

the other people mm-hmm

and so you're thinking that you're not

as flexible as the other people I'm

wondering if that's what yoga is about

civility well I think I think that

people go to become flexible but I think

that maybe some people are already just

flexible mm-hmm so you are concerned

that maybe you might not be as flexible

as the rest yeah and you'd be a beginner

well I'm worried I wouldn't be able to

do the poses in class

okay so what do you think would happen

if you couldn't do the poses in class

well I I feel embarrassed I think and

then if the teacher tried to get me to

do it and everybody else would see that

they're trying to get me into a pose and

I think it would be embarrassing okay so

you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do

the certain poses and how would you feel

if you could do all the poses in the

class

well I think I feel really good and so

what do you think it is preventing you

from not doing all the poses in the

class why I guess it's just the

embarrassment of maybe not being able to

do it what what would cause you to not

be able to do it with the closest or not

I'm not sure okay

I remember when you first came in last

week you told me that when you were

younger you used to be very very

flexible and I'm wondering what would

make that difference between then and

now well when I was a kid I used to just

practice a stretch a lot and now that I

don't I don't have that same flexibility

mm-hmm so as I've gotten older I've lost

a lot of flexibility and how would it be

if you couldn't do all the poses in the

class and you did get embarrassed and

you just let it be embarrassed I mean it

would be okay but I don't I don't like

that feeling what would be the payoff do

you think if you put up with a little

bit of embarrassment well I probably

feel we're not a good in the end you

know I can give you a lots of studies

that I can give you and videos that I

can show you of people that started yoga

and started practicing yoga and their

anxiety went way down as a matter of

fact some studies show that anxiety

doing yoga can be decreased the same as

medications so I'm not sure if you were

if you knew that or not I didn't really

know that I just thought that that yoga

was more about flexibility I didn't

realize there were so many other

benefits okay so how motivated would

that make you feel on a scale of one to

ten well I probably if I thought that

I'd be it would make me less anxious I

think I'd probably be around an eight or

nine good good

that's a definite improvement and and

you could determine after that first

class whether you're

levels have decreased or not and that

would that be validation for you or

would that be you give you even more

motivation if your anxiety levels were

decreased instantly after the yoga class

I think that would be a lot of

motivation okay to continue so one other

thing that I wanted to to mention to you

um was you said that you'd walk your dog

in nature and I'm curious as to how much

time did you spend walking your dog in

nature wow it was only about 30 minutes

it was really cold and windy so we

didn't want to stay out and by we I mean

the dog and I mmm-hmm

and so because of it was cold and Wendy

you decided to kind of cut the walk

short yeah

and and that's definitely understandable

I'm wondering what you could do to

possibly get an hour of walking the dog

in a day Wow it might help if I take a

jacket next time okay so if you took a

check in case it's gold yeah and do you

have a special place in nature that

makes you feel peaceful that you could

be and that would help you even more

enjoy it as long as I'm just away from

road noise and traffic and then it's a

lot better okay and there's lots of

trails around my house like that okay

excellent it's great that you have

trails around your house where you're

not exposed to all that noise and so do

you think you could commit to an hour

probably and on a scale of one to ten

tell me what that probably means um it's

probably a ten I can I can

to that okay all right so it sounds like

last week you had a few problems

carrying out play assignments towards

decreasing your anxiety you really

couldn't find a yoga class because

you're already signed up for a gym that

doesn't have the yoga classes but you

you already know about the yoga videos

that I've sent you so you could actually

do them at home how strongly do you feel

about doing them at home if I could do

them at home I would probably do them

all the time mm-hmm I think that would

be a big difference and then there would

be no embarrassment factor if you

couldn't do the poses less coffee you've

gone from two cups to one cup that's

to ten you think that you could spend at

least an hour a day walking with the dog

job I think we have a plan

so overall on all four of these items

how motivated do you feel on a scale of

one to ten I think it's a 10 I think I

can do them on all four all four

fabulous and how do you think you will

feel if you were to envision how you

would feel incorporating all of these

items in your life next week of the

course of next week how much of a

difference do you think it would make

you feel I think it but maybe even make

me look forward to doing these

if I were doing them on a regular basis

mm-hmm and how would it make you feel I

think it would make me feel really good

and so you feel relaxed and you would

feel more positive and I think you would

- very good thank you

we'll check in next week we'll make an

appointment for next week and catch up

and see how you're doing with all this

good job thank you so much

Liz how are you yeah good it's good to

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:08,470
see you yeah again your bench record

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,690
this week is the last last week as was

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,669
like kind of squeaky clean

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,360
so how's that been feeling I'm sure it

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,410
does it really does

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,060
yeah it's been really a process so

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,250
that's fantastic what tell me about

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:30,070
what's been going on this week had me I

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,969
just talked with her on the phone and

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,190
yeah I just went really well actually

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,519
after that we planned a Skype meeting we

13
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:42,190
got a Skype meeting last night yes it

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,289
was and yeah caught up a little bit and

15
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,749
kind of talked about some things great

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,300
yeah oh nice nice I'm happy to hear

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,390
about that and then I don't remember

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,050
anything from last time like any Alan

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,750
updates or things going okay good I'm

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,659
happy to hear that and then I guess the

21
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,009
other thing I wanted to you know talk

22
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:10,119
with you about I know that we you know

23
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,990
kind of had mentioned it briefly but

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,549
today kind of marks the kind of

25
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,829
beginning of that kind of final phase

26
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,079
for us like so then over the next you

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,520
know three sessions we're going to be

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,990
he's trying to kind of wrap up or work

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,390
together and yeah I've been feeling that

30
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,890
way cuz it's like it's hard to it's hard

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,149
to want to bring that up because it's

32
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,159
really it's been really just great

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,950
working with you and so I really don't

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,270
want to see that come to an end but I

35
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,700
thought one of the things that's really

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,500
important is maybe just to get us

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,119
starting to talk about and again we

38
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,469
don't have to do it all today but just

39
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,990
at least get us starting to talk about

40
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,310
you know some of the changes that you've

41
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,829
made things that have gone really well

42
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,009
for you and really maybe kind of recap

43
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,170
like how it is that you've gone from

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,299
like almost like binging daily to almost

45
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,789
now you're not at all and kind of maybe

46
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,770
we can kind of talk about how that's

47
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,060
gone because I think the other thing

48
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,950
that's really important is not only the

49
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,590
things that you've done in terms of like

50
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,630
how things have gotten better for you

51
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,949
but I also want us to start thinking

52
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,409
about to like okay what's going to

53
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,300
happen when we you know kind of get to

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,740
the end of our work together

55
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,200
and you know beyond so like in terms of

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
like how old kind of how you'll kind of

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,840
keep the work on and so yeah I kind of

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,250
thought you know I like I feel like I'm

59
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,420
kind of being a like a wet blanket here

60
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,440
you've had a really great week and now

61
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm bringing up you know kind of

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,110
departure but I think it's really

63
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,550
important to kind of mark that mark that

64
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,770
transition and also to market to by

65
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,660
having you know things go so well I

66
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,240
think it's really important so and I

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,500
guess the first thing I want to talk

68
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,410
about is I guess I'm pointing my my pad

69
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,730
of paper because it's like it's so

70
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,470
filled with just all the different

71
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,180
things that have occurred for you you

72
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,190
know over the last several weeks and I

73
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,050
think the first thing that's really

74
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,900
notable to me is I I really have really

75
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,730
appreciated your willingness to engage

76
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,740
your mom because I know that that's been

77
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,830
so hard for you and it's been so painful

78
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,080
you know the way that she's treated you

79
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,930
in the past but that I guess I'm even

80
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,920
getting kind of emotional talking about

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,420
because they've just been so rich the

82
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,070
transition you've made in terms of the

83
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,990
way you've engaged her in a more genuine

84
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,940
way and allowed her kind of back into

85
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,320
your life and it seems like that that's

86
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,780
been you know really vital to your you

87
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,860
know like getting better yeah so what

88
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,240
what's you know in terms of like from

89
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,680
your perspective kind of what's that

90
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,850
been like for you it's kind of

91
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,740
emotionally and it feels good it's nice

92
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,870
not butting heads with her because I'm

93
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,990
sure I don't I don't choose purposefully

94
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,450
to not have a good relationship with

95
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,040
Harry right yeah feels really good I

96
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,870
feel like I can have better

97
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,810
relationships other places as well no

98
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,050
because that's healthier right money and

99
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,370
also too I think along with that is that

100
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,580
kind of the strategies I think that

101
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,860
you've you know my hunch would be is

102
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,210
that some of the strategies that you've

103
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,250
used to engage your mom in a more

104
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,720
meaningful way of really kind of come in

105
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,550
handy in some respects in terms of like

106
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,500
some of the other relationships that

107
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,970
you've had you know especially I know

108
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,560
that you know Kathy I've gotten a lot

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,890
closer and even the fact that you've

110
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,390
allowed yourself to kind of you know

111
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,950
connect with somebody else like you know

112
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,430
with al

113
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,470
you know I know you were talking with me

114
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,690
did other day about some other friends

115
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,400
that you've you know met and people that

116
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,720
you've really got a little bit closer to

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,389
so that's been really exciting yeah yeah

118
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,259
so then then kind of from from your

119
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,820
perspective again you know we'll talk

120
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,880
more about this I mean you know as you I

121
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,380
mean I realize I'm kind of putting you

122
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,030
on the spot but as you've kind of have

123
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,110
thought about or thinking about it and

124
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,520
maybe you can think about it too even

125
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,780
from now into the next couple of

126
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,190
sessions but just starting to think

127
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,930
about like what is it that you've really

128
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,490
done that you really feel like it's been

129
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,080
really that's really helped you make

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,970
changes in the way in which you've you

131
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,139
know managed your food or your binge

132
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,699
eating I mean just really tryna be more

133
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,500
positive within my relationships and

134
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,560
being more open communicating not

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
keeping things in I feel like and I kept

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,310
things in it kind of boiled up and

137
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:34,000
that's what made me one is and I yeah I

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,150
mean like something bothers me do you

139
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,050
like immediately express it mm-hmm

140
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,400
right you know I've noticed that as well

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,599
and it seems like that that's been one

142
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,860
of the important things that you've done

143
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,810
it's really helped you know with the

144
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,419
changes that you've made what else feels

145
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,800
like that I mean you know I mean

146
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,300
obviously that's been really important

147
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,080
but what are the other things that

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,729
you've noticed in terms of like you know

149
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:58,539
how it's been going

150
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:05,650
ah I feel better about myself and like

151
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,930
not having comments my mom anymore and

152
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,470
having a guy in my life who really likes

153
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,360
how I look yeah yeah yeah feeling

154
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,820
happier with myself mm-hmm grades are

155
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,419
good

156
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,400
ya know you know things like you're like

157
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,050
we're really in a good space and I think

158
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,659
the other thing too I was aware of that

159
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:27,400
we you know that you had mentioned to me

160
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,360
in particular last time was that you

161
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,560
know you can get a chance filet to talk

162
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,909
with you as much about it I think we had

163
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,710
so much to talk about last session but I

164
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,960
was really struck by the fact that you

165
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,440
it seems like you haven't been as body

166
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,380
conscious as you have been in the past

167
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,750
and I didn't know if you if you've

168
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,200
noticed that yeah I feel you know like a

169
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,660
little bit noticed it yeah especially

170
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,790
that you bring it up this trail right

171
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,250
yeah because I know like initially and

172
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,660
even like there been times even along

173
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,370
the way when you'll make like you know I

174
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,930
didn't feel like it looked very good or

175
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,040
I felt like something felt really tight

176
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,320
on me or you know I just felt like that

177
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,790
other people were looking at me or maybe

178
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,070
judging me but it seems like that that

179
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,870
as we've kind of moved along that

180
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,550
there's really been I've really noticed

181
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,880
a real kind of a shift in the way in

182
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,930
which you've kind of been regarding

183
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,490
yourself and it seems like it's been a

184
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,290
little bit different I'm not hearing

185
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,170
like any comments at all mom about any

186
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,840
of that stuff I feel like I've gotten to

187
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,550
the point where I'm not concerned like

188
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,050
that I'm gonna hear a comment yeah right

189
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,250
okay but so I'm gonna go ahead and make

190
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,120
you talk about it anyway

191
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,770
but what did you do in order to be able

192
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,570
to get those comments though to stop

193
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,740
because obviously I think you did

194
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,900
something really significant with her I

195
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,210
I mean I thought about what you said

196
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,360
about really acknowledging that that put

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,800
a lot of paint on me yes and we yeah ya

198
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,010
know I was able to let her know that and

199
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,750
it's hard I was scared to tell her that

200
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:05,080
mm-hmm she recognized that yeah yeah she

201
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,420
kind of explained how she thought that

202
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,470
she was helping here she wanted me to

203
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,930
have a lot of friends in high school and

204
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,350
that's the what she I mean she kind of

205
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,000
said like her mom said the same thing to

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,740
her yeah yeah well you know and that's

207
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,930
really not uncommon when you have you

208
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,420
know it's funny that just even like you

209
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,940
know not you know I do big research head

210
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,080
but it seems like that that's pretty

211
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,840
consistent and you know kind of like you

212
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,510
know mothers to daughters who become

213
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,070
mothers to daughters like sometimes it's

214
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,700
kind of what we call this

215
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,100
intergenerational transmission of like

216
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,080
you know kind of criticality about you

217
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,120
know shape and weight and and you know

218
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,160
some you know really proud of you that

219
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,400
you you know kind of had the courage to

220
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,990
address it with her

221
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,980
luckily and just let her know how you

222
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,860
feel because you know I think you know

223
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,380
as a parent I know that you oh it's like

224
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,000
you know I always want to try to do the

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
right thing you know and I always you

226
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,760
know I don't purposely want to try to

227
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,410
you know inflict pain on my children

228
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,399
even though my daughters would suggest

229
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,020
that I probably do but in general I

230
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,970
don't that's not my goal is to be you

231
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,290
know harsh and critical in fact I really

232
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,270
always you know try to really be helpful

233
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,220
and I think most parents try to do the

234
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,260
right thing but I and I think maybe your

235
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,850
mom just didn't realize that agree to

236
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,920
which that really bothered you and how

237
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,740
much that hurt and in many respects how

238
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,420
much that kind of really drove you to

239
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,670
you know really you know take it out on

240
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,260
yourself so to speak and so for you to

241
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,490
have the courage to bring that up I

242
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,770
think was really helpful yeah yes I

243
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,420
really think that that made a lot of

244
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,410
differences as well as you know kind of

245
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,660
reaching out to others and and again in

246
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,040
just the open expression of your

247
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,520
feelings so yeah so yeah I think the

248
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,899
things that we're doing like now I think

249
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,910
I really like to see us kind of continue

250
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,740
to you know obviously you still are

251
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,270
doing a lot of really good work in terms

252
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,350
of like the things that you're talking

253
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,350
about and but yet I'm also aware that

254
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,850
you know as we're over the next couple

255
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,800
sessions we can kind of keep doing a few

256
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
of these things kind of wrapping up and

257
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
and then our last session we can more or

258
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,620
less kind of formally you know say

259
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,120
goodbye and talk about kind of like what

260
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,190
the next steps are and you know some

261
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,720
things that you might want to be paying

262
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,250
attention to or things you might want to

263
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,020
you know be mindful of but we'll get

264
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,540
there so yeah great","Liz how are you yeah good it's good to

see you yeah again your bench record

this week is the last last week as was

like kind of squeaky clean

so how's that been feeling I'm sure it

does it really does

yeah it's been really a process so

that's fantastic what tell me about

what's been going on this week had me I

just talked with her on the phone and

yeah I just went really well actually

after that we planned a Skype meeting we

got a Skype meeting last night yes it

was and yeah caught up a little bit and

kind of talked about some things great

yeah oh nice nice I'm happy to hear

about that and then I don't remember

anything from last time like any Alan

updates or things going okay good I'm

happy to hear that and then I guess the

other thing I wanted to you know talk

with you about I know that we you know

kind of had mentioned it briefly but

today kind of marks the kind of

beginning of that kind of final phase

for us like so then over the next you

know three sessions we're going to be

he's trying to kind of wrap up or work

together and yeah I've been feeling that

way cuz it's like it's hard to it's hard

to want to bring that up because it's

really it's been really just great

working with you and so I really don't

want to see that come to an end but I

thought one of the things that's really

important is maybe just to get us

starting to talk about and again we

don't have to do it all today but just

at least get us starting to talk about

you know some of the changes that you've

made things that have gone really well

for you and really maybe kind of recap

like how it is that you've gone from

like almost like binging daily to almost

now you're not at all and kind of maybe

we can kind of talk about how that's

gone because I think the other thing

that's really important is not only the

things that you've done in terms of like

how things have gotten better for you

but I also want us to start thinking

about to like okay what's going to

happen when we you know kind of get to

the end of our work together

and you know beyond so like in terms of

like how old kind of how you'll kind of

keep the work on and so yeah I kind of

thought you know I like I feel like I'm

kind of being a like a wet blanket here

you've had a really great week and now

I'm bringing up you know kind of

departure but I think it's really

important to kind of mark that mark that

transition and also to market to by

having you know things go so well I

think it's really important so and I

guess the first thing I want to talk

about is I guess I'm pointing my my pad

of paper because it's like it's so

filled with just all the different

things that have occurred for you you

know over the last several weeks and I

think the first thing that's really

notable to me is I I really have really

appreciated your willingness to engage

your mom because I know that that's been

so hard for you and it's been so painful

you know the way that she's treated you

in the past but that I guess I'm even

getting kind of emotional talking about

because they've just been so rich the

transition you've made in terms of the

way you've engaged her in a more genuine

way and allowed her kind of back into

your life and it seems like that that's

been you know really vital to your you

know like getting better yeah so what

what's you know in terms of like from

your perspective kind of what's that

been like for you it's kind of

emotionally and it feels good it's nice

not butting heads with her because I'm

sure I don't I don't choose purposefully

to not have a good relationship with

Harry right yeah feels really good I

feel like I can have better

relationships other places as well no

because that's healthier right money and

also too I think along with that is that

kind of the strategies I think that

you've you know my hunch would be is

that some of the strategies that you've

used to engage your mom in a more

meaningful way of really kind of come in

handy in some respects in terms of like

some of the other relationships that

you've had you know especially I know

that you know Kathy I've gotten a lot

closer and even the fact that you've

allowed yourself to kind of you know

connect with somebody else like you know

with al

you know I know you were talking with me

did other day about some other friends

that you've you know met and people that

you've really got a little bit closer to

so that's been really exciting yeah yeah

so then then kind of from from your

perspective again you know we'll talk

more about this I mean you know as you I

mean I realize I'm kind of putting you

on the spot but as you've kind of have

thought about or thinking about it and

maybe you can think about it too even

from now into the next couple of

sessions but just starting to think

about like what is it that you've really

done that you really feel like it's been

really that's really helped you make

changes in the way in which you've you

know managed your food or your binge

eating I mean just really tryna be more

positive within my relationships and

being more open communicating not

keeping things in I feel like and I kept

things in it kind of boiled up and

that's what made me one is and I yeah I

mean like something bothers me do you

like immediately express it mm-hmm

right you know I've noticed that as well

and it seems like that that's been one

of the important things that you've done

it's really helped you know with the

changes that you've made what else feels

like that I mean you know I mean

obviously that's been really important

but what are the other things that

you've noticed in terms of like you know

how it's been going

ah I feel better about myself and like

not having comments my mom anymore and

having a guy in my life who really likes

how I look yeah yeah yeah feeling

happier with myself mm-hmm grades are

good

ya know you know things like you're like

we're really in a good space and I think

the other thing too I was aware of that

we you know that you had mentioned to me

in particular last time was that you

know you can get a chance filet to talk

with you as much about it I think we had

so much to talk about last session but I

was really struck by the fact that you

it seems like you haven't been as body

conscious as you have been in the past

and I didn't know if you if you've

noticed that yeah I feel you know like a

little bit noticed it yeah especially

that you bring it up this trail right

yeah because I know like initially and

even like there been times even along

the way when you'll make like you know I

didn't feel like it looked very good or

I felt like something felt really tight

on me or you know I just felt like that

other people were looking at me or maybe

judging me but it seems like that that

as we've kind of moved along that

there's really been I've really noticed

a real kind of a shift in the way in

which you've kind of been regarding

yourself and it seems like it's been a

little bit different I'm not hearing

like any comments at all mom about any

of that stuff I feel like I've gotten to

the point where I'm not concerned like

that I'm gonna hear a comment yeah right

okay but so I'm gonna go ahead and make

you talk about it anyway

but what did you do in order to be able

to get those comments though to stop

because obviously I think you did

something really significant with her I

I mean I thought about what you said

about really acknowledging that that put

a lot of paint on me yes and we yeah ya

know I was able to let her know that and

it's hard I was scared to tell her that

mm-hmm she recognized that yeah yeah she

kind of explained how she thought that

she was helping here she wanted me to

have a lot of friends in high school and

that's the what she I mean she kind of

said like her mom said the same thing to

her yeah yeah well you know and that's

really not uncommon when you have you

know it's funny that just even like you

know not you know I do big research head

but it seems like that that's pretty

consistent and you know kind of like you

know mothers to daughters who become

mothers to daughters like sometimes it's

kind of what we call this

intergenerational transmission of like

you know kind of criticality about you

know shape and weight and and you know

some you know really proud of you that

you you know kind of had the courage to

address it with her

luckily and just let her know how you

feel because you know I think you know

as a parent I know that you oh it's like

you know I always want to try to do the

right thing you know and I always you

know I don't purposely want to try to

you know inflict pain on my children

even though my daughters would suggest

that I probably do but in general I

don't that's not my goal is to be you

know harsh and critical in fact I really

always you know try to really be helpful

and I think most parents try to do the

right thing but I and I think maybe your

mom just didn't realize that agree to

which that really bothered you and how

much that hurt and in many respects how

much that kind of really drove you to

you know really you know take it out on

yourself so to speak and so for you to

have the courage to bring that up I

think was really helpful yeah yes I

really think that that made a lot of

differences as well as you know kind of

reaching out to others and and again in

just the open expression of your

feelings so yeah so yeah I think the

things that we're doing like now I think

I really like to see us kind of continue

to you know obviously you still are

doing a lot of really good work in terms

of like the things that you're talking

about and but yet I'm also aware that

you know as we're over the next couple

sessions we can kind of keep doing a few

of these things kind of wrapping up and

and then our last session we can more or

less kind of formally you know say

goodbye and talk about kind of like what

the next steps are and you know some

things that you might want to be paying

attention to or things you might want to

you know be mindful of but we'll get

there so yeah great

00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,500
okay sorry so if you could just give me

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,690
an idea of how things have been for you

3
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,050
since we last met yeah this week has

4
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,780
been a little bit difficult I found it

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,340
really hard to sleep the last few nights

6
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,540
so I think it's because a few nights ago

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,460
I had like a really bad nightmare where

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,460
I like envisioned the lorry like coming

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,820
towards me and then now I avoid sleep

10
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,340
because I don't want to be back in that

11
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,479
state of panic okay so that was last

12
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,729
week when you had had the nightmare yeah

13
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,290
and how was it when you woke up like I

14
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,200
was really hot and I was like all

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,970
bothered and I just didn't want to go

16
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,450
back to sleep I think also because I've

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,210
been having quite a lot of daydreams

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,789
where I'm back at the event it feels

19
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,220
like I'm back there and I'm trapped and

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,430
it's happening again so yeah it's been

21
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,130
it's been quite tough this week yeah so

22
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,170
it sounds like it's been a difficult

23
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,119
week and there's been quite a few

24
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,810
nightmares yes some daydreams can

25
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,030
flashback do in the daytime yeah

26
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,170
and you've mentioned though that you've

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,569
felt that you were back there yeah yeah

28
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:53,229
okay so it sounds like you might be

29
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,500
experiencing what we call dissociation

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,729
okay is that something that you've heard

31
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,860
of well I think I've heard of it but I

32
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,929
don't know much of my eye or

33
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,840
dissociation is it's when people lose

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,450
connection with the present and it can

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,880
feel like they're maybe back at another

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,720
time or we can feel quite disorientated

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,750
or confused about where they are okay

38
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,940
that sound familiar yeah it sounds a

39
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,840
little bit like what you were saying

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
yeah definitely

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,230
what sort of times does it happen for

42
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,760
you then it tends to have them at night

43
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,300
when I'm asleep I might have a nightmare

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,310
and that might you know bring me back to

45
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,340
a kind of being trapped in the car and

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,870
being like in a state of panic but

47
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,099
sometimes it happens when I'm at work

48
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,760
and I'm not doing that much

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,980
should my mind starts to wander a bay

50
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,099
okay yeah so it's happening reasonably

51
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,230
frequently a moment then yeah that

52
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,060
sounds like it's something that's quite

53
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,890
important for us to think yeah a bit

54
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,950
more okay so maybe if I explained to you

55
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,390
first about a little bit more about what

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,720
dissociation is yeah yeah hey I think it

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,790
might be easier if I jump up and kind of

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,650
do a bit of drawing Oh getting the slip

59
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,810
boys that's okay yeah yeah okay so the

60
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,060
important thing to remember about

61
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,160
dissociation is it's actually a really

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,920
normal human experience that lots of

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,160
people report experiencing to some to

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,660
some level okay so we talked about

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,519
dissociation as being along a continuum

66
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,560
okay so at this end which is a

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,150
dissociation that most people report

68
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,709
people might talk about things like em

69
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,329
so it's just going on autopilot and I

70
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,500
was wondering if there's anything that

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,810
you can think of maybe before your car

72
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,239
crash that that reminds you of that of

73
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,329
like time going virally yeah and maybe

74
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,049
feeling like you're on autopilot I

75
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,430
suppose like if you're watching a film

76
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,340
and like you don't realize the time

77
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,810
passing or if you're like having a

78
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,419
really good day and it's like five

79
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,419
o'clock and yeah yeah that's a really

80
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,859
good point to it often people kind of

81
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,930
don't notice that at times past yeah

82
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,728
yeah so so it's kind of films books can

83
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,130
kind of read in the same thing yeah okay

84
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,930
daydreaming is one as well and the other

85
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,400
one that comes up quite often is when

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,860
people are driving maybe a journey that

87
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,570
they've done time and time again and

88
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,520
sort of would just arrive there and

89
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,780
don't necessarily remember all the

90
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,380
details of their journey right here yeah

91
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,210
at this end dissociation is really quite

92
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,130
problematic and really interferes with

93
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,740
people's day-to-day lives and people can

94
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,840
find it that they not functioning very

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,750
well at all so it's a lot rarer

96
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,900
as many people experienced okay well

97
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,520
what happens is that when people go

98
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,650
through traumatic experiences so similar

99
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,110
to the ones that that we've talked about

100
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,740
with your car crash it pushes you up

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,190
this continuum and most people who are

102
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,980
experiencing symptoms of PTSD tend to be

103
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,640
around this part of this continuum what

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,800
happens is that there are types of

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,590
dissociation that they experience can be

106
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,840
quite different and the intensity and

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,840
the frequency can increase as well so

108
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,580
you know you were talking about your

109
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,650
nightmares and your flashbacks and some

110
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,470
of those images that you get those would

111
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,900
be the types of dissociation or it you'd

112
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,610
be experiencing so I just pop those on

113
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,880
here

114
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,440
so what'd you make of that so far yeah

115
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,389
and I didn't realize that it existed you

116
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,630
know in the auto pilot and example that

117
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,230
you gave

118
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,180
so before trauma so that that's

119
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,150
interesting to see it you know visually

120
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,660
there yeah so it's really normal and but

121
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,010
it's just that you you've cracked up

122
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,550
that continuum a bit really ok so it

123
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,200
sounds like you nightmares and your

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,540
flashbacks and your memories are causing

125
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,310
you your some difficulties at the moment

126
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,380
so I suppose it makes sense for us to

127
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,540
maybe think about how we can help you

128
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,970
come down this continuum a little bit

129
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,750
yeah so one of the one of the main ways

130
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,480
that one of the main things that we do

131
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,490
with regards to dissociation is we use

132
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,710
something called grounding okay

133
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,930
so grounding techniques it kind of do

134
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,550
what what they say on the tin really

135
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,250
it's about grounding you in the present

136
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,680
moment suppose it's like keeping two

137
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,320
feet on the ground because when people

138
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,240
dissociate they lose that connection

139
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,340
with the here and now and can kind of

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,100
become quiet disorientated so grounding

141
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,390
is kind of the opposite of that and

142
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,370
helping you to stay present in the

143
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,410
moment okay okay so there's a lots of

144
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,590
different ways of using grounding but

145
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,570
some of the people I've worked with in

146
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,160
the past have found it quite useful to

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,750
think about it in terms of the five

148
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,330
senses and just means at you if we can

149
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,440
give you lots of different options to

150
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,630
try then so I'm just going to kind of

151
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,520
draw a quick table of putting up on here

152
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,910
and right

153
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,880
okay so we've got touch taste smell

154
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,389
sight and hearing so maybe if we take

155
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,639
the example of you nightmares and we can

156
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,410
think through some of the things that

157
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,539
you could do to help ground yourself in

158
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,270
the present moment when you come to from

159
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,060
a nightmare okay yeah so what where do

160
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,500
you want to start this movie touch yeah

161
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,199
touch is fine okay so thinking about

162
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,820
when you wake up from a nightmare then

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,060
and where are you usually in my bed yeah

164
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,570
in my bedroom okay yeah so is there

165
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,340
anything that's around you in your

166
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,220
bedroom that my help remind you where

167
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,300
you are yeah I have a throw on my bed

168
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,870
which is really soft so maybe that could

169
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,750
be a good thing to touch to remind me

170
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,820
that you know I'm in a safe place

171
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,450
yeah my bedroom that's really yeah it's

172
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,219
a really good example and it also sounds

173
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,500
like that's quite confident yep to you

174
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,839
as well just really important yeah okay

175
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,400
so it's a great example what do you

176
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,980
think for taste Riccio on it I could

177
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,680
like keep something next to my bed that

178
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,200
I like a mint or something yeah

179
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:05,060
yeah what about smell also I suppose my

180
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,170
room smells a bit like perfume or like

181
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,410
if I've lit a candle it's kind of got a

182
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,320
homely smell about butter that sounds

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,940
quite soothing as well I guess similar

184
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,580
to the throw example yeah okay from

185
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,570
Kazon

186
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,460
maybe one thing just to mention about

187
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,500
the perfume is that when we're thinking

188
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
about grounding techniques it can be

189
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,190
really really helpful to think about

190
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,470
things that have happened since the

191
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,540
crash or that you don't associate with

192
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,980
the crash because the last thing we want

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,240
to do is to be kind of em you know it

194
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,160
kind of feeding into those memories we

195
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,480
want it to be something that's quite

196
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,970
separate so it just made me think when

197
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,770
you said perfume that it might not be

198
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,990
might be a better idea to smell a

199
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,180
perfume which you weren't wearing at the

200
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,100
time with a crash for example I may be

201
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,440
one that you've bought since okay cool

202
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,870
make sense yep

203
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:12,870
outside maybe I have like some photos in

204
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,260
my room which might remind me of like

205
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,560
you know loved ones or you know fun

206
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,260
things that I've done yeah this one

207
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,080
hearing it's usually quite quiet in my

208
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,510
bedroom except for maybe like my

209
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,230
partner's snoring or like three then

210
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,810
yeah oh yeah yeah that's good I example

211
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,750
yeah so you your partner storing and

212
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,180
Pammy wait were you on your own then the

213
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,700
ah yeah yeah yes oh that actually it's a

214
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,400
really good one because maybe if you

215
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,110
were able to listen to your partner

216
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,060
snowing it might also remind you not

217
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,560
only where you are but also that you're

218
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,029
not on your own yeah as well

219
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,810
that could be very useful one okay so

220
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,360
we've got some really good examples here

221
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,510
so other when do you think you could use

222
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,650
this or when do you think this might be

223
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,890
useful to use this approach and well at

224
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,900
night and would be released will because

225
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,000
a lot of those things are to do with my

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,579
bedroom but also I suppose if I was at

227
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,040
work and I was having a daydream then I

228
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,660
could just have some or if I was in the

229
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,930
car with my partner and I was getting in

230
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,160
a panic I could just have some mints

231
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,860
nearby it maybe that would give me like

232
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,380
a strong taste of something that I

233
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,820
didn't have

234
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,420
when I was in the car night you know and

235
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,570
the lorry was coming towards me yeah so

236
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,460
again it's about reminding yourself

237
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,310
where you are and really emphasizing

238
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,810
what's different about about that

239
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,110
situation yeah great so yeah we've got

240
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,850
lots of different options really because

241
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,280
for that reason you know if you're if

242
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,860
you're in the car going somewhere maybe

243
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,240
with a family member or something you

244
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,430
know it's likely that your partner's

245
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,960
going to be with you snoring you might

246
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,120
well be but but yes it's good to have

247
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,560
some some different options so so the

248
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,060
idea isn't that you you know that you

249
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,650
kind of try all of these at once it's

250
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,900
more about you going away and trying

251
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,220
some things out and working out what

252
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,240
works for you

253
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,370
and then you can carry on using the ones

254
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:29,100
so that fit for you okay okay so if

255
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,070
you've got any questions about any of

256
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,740
that already get a feedback on how that

257
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,310
was looking at that yeah I think it

258
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,890
could be useful I'm willing to you know

259
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,010
obviously try whatever I can with the

260
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,280
photos could I use photos on my phone

261
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,750
like if obviously I'm not in my room

262
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,370
yeah that's a great idea you know as

263
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,630
we've all got these smart phones now

264
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,280
haven't they so yeah that's that's a

265
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,150
really good option as well yeah yeah so

266
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,680
maybe if you have a go away and have a

267
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
go at some of those things and maybe we

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,980
can you can have a chat about it next

269
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,350
time okay go right right thanks Sarah","okay sorry so if you could just give me

an idea of how things have been for you

since we last met yeah this week has

been a little bit difficult I found it

really hard to sleep the last few nights

so I think it's because a few nights ago

I had like a really bad nightmare where

I like envisioned the lorry like coming

towards me and then now I avoid sleep

because I don't want to be back in that

state of panic okay so that was last

week when you had had the nightmare yeah

and how was it when you woke up like I

was really hot and I was like all

bothered and I just didn't want to go

back to sleep I think also because I've

been having quite a lot of daydreams

where I'm back at the event it feels

like I'm back there and I'm trapped and

it's happening again so yeah it's been

it's been quite tough this week yeah so

it sounds like it's been a difficult

week and there's been quite a few

nightmares yes some daydreams can

flashback do in the daytime yeah

and you've mentioned though that you've

felt that you were back there yeah yeah

okay so it sounds like you might be

experiencing what we call dissociation

okay is that something that you've heard

of well I think I've heard of it but I

don't know much of my eye or

dissociation is it's when people lose

connection with the present and it can

feel like they're maybe back at another

time or we can feel quite disorientated

or confused about where they are okay

that sound familiar yeah it sounds a

little bit like what you were saying

yeah definitely

what sort of times does it happen for

you then it tends to have them at night

when I'm asleep I might have a nightmare

and that might you know bring me back to

a kind of being trapped in the car and

being like in a state of panic but

sometimes it happens when I'm at work

and I'm not doing that much

should my mind starts to wander a bay

okay yeah so it's happening reasonably

frequently a moment then yeah that

sounds like it's something that's quite

important for us to think yeah a bit

more okay so maybe if I explained to you

first about a little bit more about what

dissociation is yeah yeah hey I think it

might be easier if I jump up and kind of

do a bit of drawing Oh getting the slip

boys that's okay yeah yeah okay so the

important thing to remember about

dissociation is it's actually a really

normal human experience that lots of

people report experiencing to some to

some level okay so we talked about

dissociation as being along a continuum

okay so at this end which is a

dissociation that most people report

people might talk about things like em

so it's just going on autopilot and I

was wondering if there's anything that

you can think of maybe before your car

crash that that reminds you of that of

like time going virally yeah and maybe

feeling like you're on autopilot I

suppose like if you're watching a film

and like you don't realize the time

passing or if you're like having a

really good day and it's like five

o'clock and yeah yeah that's a really

good point to it often people kind of

don't notice that at times past yeah

yeah so so it's kind of films books can

kind of read in the same thing yeah okay

daydreaming is one as well and the other

one that comes up quite often is when

people are driving maybe a journey that

they've done time and time again and

sort of would just arrive there and

don't necessarily remember all the

details of their journey right here yeah

at this end dissociation is really quite

problematic and really interferes with

people's day-to-day lives and people can

find it that they not functioning very

well at all so it's a lot rarer

as many people experienced okay well

what happens is that when people go

through traumatic experiences so similar

to the ones that that we've talked about

with your car crash it pushes you up

this continuum and most people who are

experiencing symptoms of PTSD tend to be

around this part of this continuum what

happens is that there are types of

dissociation that they experience can be

quite different and the intensity and

the frequency can increase as well so

you know you were talking about your

nightmares and your flashbacks and some

of those images that you get those would

be the types of dissociation or it you'd

be experiencing so I just pop those on

here

so what'd you make of that so far yeah

and I didn't realize that it existed you

know in the auto pilot and example that

you gave

so before trauma so that that's

interesting to see it you know visually

there yeah so it's really normal and but

it's just that you you've cracked up

that continuum a bit really ok so it

sounds like you nightmares and your

flashbacks and your memories are causing

you your some difficulties at the moment

so I suppose it makes sense for us to

maybe think about how we can help you

come down this continuum a little bit

yeah so one of the one of the main ways

that one of the main things that we do

with regards to dissociation is we use

something called grounding okay

so grounding techniques it kind of do

what what they say on the tin really

it's about grounding you in the present

moment suppose it's like keeping two

feet on the ground because when people

dissociate they lose that connection

with the here and now and can kind of

become quiet disorientated so grounding

is kind of the opposite of that and

helping you to stay present in the

moment okay okay so there's a lots of

different ways of using grounding but

some of the people I've worked with in

the past have found it quite useful to

think about it in terms of the five

senses and just means at you if we can

give you lots of different options to

try then so I'm just going to kind of

draw a quick table of putting up on here

and right

okay so we've got touch taste smell

sight and hearing so maybe if we take

the example of you nightmares and we can

think through some of the things that

you could do to help ground yourself in

the present moment when you come to from

a nightmare okay yeah so what where do

you want to start this movie touch yeah

touch is fine okay so thinking about

when you wake up from a nightmare then

and where are you usually in my bed yeah

in my bedroom okay yeah so is there

anything that's around you in your

bedroom that my help remind you where

you are yeah I have a throw on my bed

which is really soft so maybe that could

be a good thing to touch to remind me

that you know I'm in a safe place

yeah my bedroom that's really yeah it's

a really good example and it also sounds

like that's quite confident yep to you

as well just really important yeah okay

so it's a great example what do you

think for taste Riccio on it I could

like keep something next to my bed that

I like a mint or something yeah

yeah what about smell also I suppose my

room smells a bit like perfume or like

if I've lit a candle it's kind of got a

homely smell about butter that sounds

quite soothing as well I guess similar

to the throw example yeah okay from

Kazon

maybe one thing just to mention about

the perfume is that when we're thinking

about grounding techniques it can be

really really helpful to think about

things that have happened since the

crash or that you don't associate with

the crash because the last thing we want

to do is to be kind of em you know it

kind of feeding into those memories we

want it to be something that's quite

separate so it just made me think when

you said perfume that it might not be

might be a better idea to smell a

perfume which you weren't wearing at the

time with a crash for example I may be

one that you've bought since okay cool

make sense yep

outside maybe I have like some photos in

my room which might remind me of like

you know loved ones or you know fun

things that I've done yeah this one

hearing it's usually quite quiet in my

bedroom except for maybe like my

partner's snoring or like three then

yeah oh yeah yeah that's good I example

yeah so you your partner storing and

Pammy wait were you on your own then the

ah yeah yeah yes oh that actually it's a

really good one because maybe if you

were able to listen to your partner

snowing it might also remind you not

only where you are but also that you're

not on your own yeah as well

that could be very useful one okay so

we've got some really good examples here

so other when do you think you could use

this or when do you think this might be

useful to use this approach and well at

night and would be released will because

a lot of those things are to do with my

bedroom but also I suppose if I was at

work and I was having a daydream then I

could just have some or if I was in the

car with my partner and I was getting in

a panic I could just have some mints

nearby it maybe that would give me like

a strong taste of something that I

didn't have

when I was in the car night you know and

the lorry was coming towards me yeah so

again it's about reminding yourself

where you are and really emphasizing

what's different about about that

situation yeah great so yeah we've got

lots of different options really because

for that reason you know if you're if

you're in the car going somewhere maybe

with a family member or something you

know it's likely that your partner's

going to be with you snoring you might

well be but but yes it's good to have

some some different options so so the

idea isn't that you you know that you

kind of try all of these at once it's

more about you going away and trying

some things out and working out what

works for you

and then you can carry on using the ones

so that fit for you okay okay so if

you've got any questions about any of

that already get a feedback on how that

was looking at that yeah I think it

could be useful I'm willing to you know

obviously try whatever I can with the

photos could I use photos on my phone

like if obviously I'm not in my room

yeah that's a great idea you know as

we've all got these smart phones now

haven't they so yeah that's that's a

really good option as well yeah yeah so

maybe if you have a go away and have a

go at some of those things and maybe we

can you can have a chat about it next

time okay go right right thanks Sarah

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,570
effect on my kids alright how much were

my sister is always there if I mean that

61
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,019
from her so occasionally you'll borrow

62
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,709
money yeah

63
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,750
how about your sleep do you feel like

64
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,590
you sleep as much as you should more

65
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,030
than you should or less than it sure

66
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,360
much less than I should talk about that

67
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,540
I mean just two kids and getting them

68
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,300
down and then take it trying to take

69
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,660
some time for myself and sometimes I'm

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,830
up late with you know being with people

71
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,130
smoking drinking it just don't sleep

72
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,310
that much

73
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,460
is that problem that you want to work on

74
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,010
yeah I guess yeah I would really like to

75
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,560
get some more sleep how about food

76
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,829
intake eating do you feel like you eat

77
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,760
more than you should less than you

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,880
should or about right more than I should

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,580
or I find myself like snacking a lot

80
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,700
during the day and I'll still have

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,830
regular meals so it's like meals on top

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,720
of snacking on top of meals on top of

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,770
snacking it's just a lot of food is that

84
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,130
an area that you want to work on do you

85
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,610
see as a problem

86
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:54,980
yeah maybe all right I want to switch

87
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,680
gears again here trauma history now he

88
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,700
already told me about the what you think

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,200
may have happened or could have happened

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,190
with your father how about any physical

91
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,450
abuse I think he mention that earlier

92
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,950
right yes well my dad would made us

93
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,860
worry over and then after he went to

94
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,100
jail um me and my mother would get into

95
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,490
fights sometimes doesn't cool fights

96
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,950
yeah had a few cousins that you know

97
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:30,340
would step over the line but I mean I

98
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,450
was involved in it so I considered abuse

99
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,280
tell me what you mean by involved in you

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,780
know I punched back

101
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,380
well

102
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,820
what do you think happened in those

103
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,580
situations you feel liked it no they

104
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,710
were they were picking on me you were

105
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,310
targeted yeah because I'm small I'm sure

106
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,170
you know my cousin's really tiring over

107
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,320
me so they would try to disrespect me

108
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,920
because they thought they could and you

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,020
would act out physically against them to

110
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,050
defend yourself huh we ever the

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,700
initiator of abuse sometimes occasion

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,850
yeah how about emotional abuse

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,889
my mom always tried to make me like I

114
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,610
was the scapegoat a lot talking about

115
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,699
that even if it was her fault that the

116
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,990
lights weren't on and there were no

117
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,870
there was no water it would somehow be

118
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,150
my fault

119
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,560
no oh well you're just I had to bail

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,539
your sister out again so you know this

121
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,259
happened and I had to drive around town

122
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,389
to find your sister because you know she

123
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,370
was just off doing her own thing so I

124
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,080
spent all the money on gas couldn't pay

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,330
them like though it's always my fault

126
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,010
everything was always on my phone even

127
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,110
though I knew it wasn't what it's no

128
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,350
Harvard that was painful for you you

129
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,729
know do you think that had an impact or

130
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,770
that or the physical abuse had an impact

131
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,720
on your life what's happening now

132
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,220
the physical abuse I guess I try to end

133
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,760
fights with violence I guess because I

134
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,770
know how bad it can get so I try to shut

135
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,220
down really fast but probably not the

136
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,160
most happiest way see that's why I think

137
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,410
my sister and me are close and so I

138
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,600
blame my mom for that because she used

139
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,790
me as a scapegoat and then my sister was

140
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,400
like oh that's the bad sister so you

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,950
think your mother's behavior led to why

142
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,060
your sister hates you now

143
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,770
any other instances of physical

144
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,440
emotional abuse

145
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,430
no not really not really","you tell me about sure

any spiritual beliefs might have well I

was raised Catholic so I mean it just I

get kind of worried cuz there's so many

rumors of what you can and cannot do

like that's not living I mean I still

believe in it I guess I was raised that

way so you consider yourself Catholic

but you feel like there's a lot of rules

yeah I mean there's a lot of do's and

don'ts our church was very like my hell

oriented like if you don't if you do

this you're gonna go to hell you do this

we're gonna go down like well let's let

that's fun

how you think those spiritual values

influence your daily life well I mean it

sometimes I do feel guilty about what I

do I feel guilty about you know spending

more money than I'm willing to admit on

drugs on parties but I mean I think you

know about forgive me

how about racial ethnic identity well I

am Mexican Mexican and I think that

affects you in daily life

well I'm very very family-oriented

family right yeah

that's why the family that I'm close

with I try to stay close to it that's

why I'm like oh my stayed as close as I

can to my sister

and you know that when things are at my

house that I don't want my kids to be

exposed to they go with her you know

well I'm looking out for them all right

can you tell me about your living

housing situation unsteady I'll just

study the word yeah I mean usually it's

about if there's a lot of us in one

house right now I'm living with about

six other people and you know the fight

happens or somebody can't pay the rent

or I can't pay the rent you know I've

moved probably about 12 times it's the

past year the past year it's a lot of

moving yeah been stressful yeah yeah I

mean sometimes I enjoy the new

environment feels like a fresh start to

me alright so there's a part of it's not

so bad

yeah but a I could see it having an

effect on my kids alright how much were

financial

by financial outlook hmm well I get

assistance from the state and I mean I

usually have enough to pay for

everything I mean there's been some days

that I've had to tell you know my

roommates say can you lend me some money

my sister is always there if I mean that

from her so occasionally you'll borrow

money yeah

how about your sleep do you feel like

you sleep as much as you should more

than you should or less than it sure

much less than I should talk about that

I mean just two kids and getting them

down and then take it trying to take

some time for myself and sometimes I'm

up late with you know being with people

smoking drinking it just don't sleep

that much

is that problem that you want to work on

yeah I guess yeah I would really like to

get some more sleep how about food

intake eating do you feel like you eat

more than you should less than you

should or about right more than I should

or I find myself like snacking a lot

during the day and I'll still have

regular meals so it's like meals on top

of snacking on top of meals on top of

snacking it's just a lot of food is that

an area that you want to work on do you

see as a problem

yeah maybe all right I want to switch

gears again here trauma history now he

already told me about the what you think

may have happened or could have happened

with your father how about any physical

abuse I think he mention that earlier

right yes well my dad would made us

worry over and then after he went to

jail um me and my mother would get into

fights sometimes doesn't cool fights

yeah had a few cousins that you know

would step over the line but I mean I

was involved in it so I considered abuse

tell me what you mean by involved in you

know I punched back

well

what do you think happened in those

situations you feel liked it no they

were they were picking on me you were

targeted yeah because I'm small I'm sure

you know my cousin's really tiring over

me so they would try to disrespect me

because they thought they could and you

would act out physically against them to

defend yourself huh we ever the

initiator of abuse sometimes occasion

yeah how about emotional abuse

my mom always tried to make me like I

was the scapegoat a lot talking about

that even if it was her fault that the

lights weren't on and there were no

there was no water it would somehow be

my fault

no oh well you're just I had to bail

your sister out again so you know this

happened and I had to drive around town

to find your sister because you know she

was just off doing her own thing so I

spent all the money on gas couldn't pay

them like though it's always my fault

everything was always on my phone even

though I knew it wasn't what it's no

Harvard that was painful for you you

know do you think that had an impact or

that or the physical abuse had an impact

on your life what's happening now

the physical abuse I guess I try to end

fights with violence I guess because I

know how bad it can get so I try to shut

down really fast but probably not the

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,729

getting angry

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,570
I guess middle school oh I still did the

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,780
clubs but it was mainly out of habit I

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,060
just kind of sat there when I was there

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,740
I didn't really participate stopped

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,750
going after a while or I would drop the

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,180
club for a month or two pick it back up

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,090
drop it again

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,910
how moving forward to high school to

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,300
high school high school was a disaster

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,880
for disaster Oh talk about that

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,450
teachers were all on my case it's like I

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,460
was barely there how are you even that

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,790
upset with me how are they upset with

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,950
you um you know they were always talking

32
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,310
about how I was not taking school

33
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,190
seriously how I had disrespectful

34
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,350
attitude and well I really I guess I

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,490
really didn't have to deal with it that

36
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,659
long I was expelled in the 11th grade

37
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,370
that the highest grade did you well

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,658

GED my GED and how does that come it

40
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,620

44
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,690
but you feel like you're able to get it

45
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,709
I think so me I know I'm smarter I just

46
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,299
choose not to do anything with it

47
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,269
all right do you have it any special

48
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,530
training for work not really all my jobs

50
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,590
but I was fired from my first job for

51
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,500
just not showing up how old were you

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,190

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,739
customer then I quit because I just

60
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,410

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,280
moving forward there um well now I work

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,049
at a warehouse so I have to talk to

66
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,359
people and they have a bunch of days

67
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,840
where like personal days where if I just

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,090
if I party a little too much one day I

69
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,489
call out they'll take out my personal

70
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,859
days and it'll be fine

71
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,109
so sounds like you like that job okay

72
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,650
meaningless work but pays the bills

73
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,470
meaningless work yeah but financially it

74
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:07,599
helps yeah yeah okay I want to switch

75
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,940
gears again that's right we've talked a

76
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:20,279
little about the marijuana and the xanax

77
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,659
are there any other behaviors you

78
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:30,070
consider yourself kind of repenting

79
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,300
engaged in like for example gambling or

80
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,590
being on the internet a lot any like

81
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,800
that

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,580
um I sometimes stay on the Internet to

83
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,909
like really early how early I mean I've

84
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:56,650
4 a.m. for them at the worst one - no

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,229
I'll have work the next day that's where

86
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,820
the personal days come in so depending

87
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,260
bang it up what attracts you about the

88
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,430
Internet why do you think you spend so

89
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,669
much time there well because it's easier

90
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,289
for me to talk to people through the

91
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,779
internet because it's a no I mean I just

92
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,639
you know like the lights above me what's

93
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,990
the deal with them anymore so it's more

94
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,990
like social media that's sure yeah

95
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,730
yeah and I get the scoop on everybody

96
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,930
so that's always interesting do you

97
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,520
consider a problem I mean it does

98
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,040
interfere with my work sometimes I mean

99
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
I do get annoyed when I look at the

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,400
clock and it's 2:00 in the morning like

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,750
oh my god I'm working eight so I want to

102
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,590
switch gears again okay to another area

103
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,460
I want to talk about your sexual history

104
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,420
okay okay okay all right

105
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,120

106
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,300
past okay okay tell me about your sexual

107
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,080
orientation

108

I am heterosexual intersexual have you

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,500
ever been abused sexually ah my father

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,190
was accused of it but to be honest it

111
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,590
you don't remember that I was so young

112
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,210
all right do you think it happened

113
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:37,289
I don't remember a lot of like while he

114
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,669
was around because it was just really

115
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,879
bad how about your drive would you

116
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,849
consider it normal or more of a drive or

117
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,079
less of a dryer than normal

118
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:59,399
I would say less less of my plate how

119
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,289
long has it been reduced drive for a

120
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:04,799
while

121
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:10,709
for a while months years I'd say at

122
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:15,299
least a year list here alright so I want

123
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,189
to switch gears again and I know you

124
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,449
touched on this earlier on tell me what

125
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,899
your legal history okay alright okay you

126
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,339
mentioned it to you I yeah what happened

127
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,679
there well I was caught with the UI in

128
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:36,209
possession but they kind of gave me slap

129
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:40,099
on the wrist if I went to limp a debauch

130
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,409
what is that what you did yep I mean I

131
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,019
stopped going in a row I went like the

132
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,269
first few times but really he's just a

133
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:52,709
really good boy yeah so other than that

134
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,299
one DUI any other legal history I've

135
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:00,409
been pretty good at hiding it alright

136
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:05,369
does dua affect your ability to find

137
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:07,619
employment keep employment is there any

138
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,049
negative impact on you yeah and it was

139
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,389
hard to find like my warehouse job now I

140
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,099
had a friend who worked there who got me

141
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,959
to be you know got me employment there

142
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,739
but if I hadn't had them then I probably

143
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:22,519
would have got a job

144
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,630
during history of military service","I want to switch gears again okay and

talk about your educational and work

history is that okay okay okay tell me

about school starting from the earliest

you remember well when I was around like

my daughter's age I was really active in

school I didn't want to go home so I

started like throwing myself into school

activities and clubs and you know did

everything under the Sun so I can stay

at school as long as possible I didn't

really have great grades but they were

okay there okay yeah I know behavioral

issues are like that have a movement

ahead a few years well around middle

schools when I started having started

getting angry

I guess middle school oh I still did the

clubs but it was mainly out of habit I

just kind of sat there when I was there

I didn't really participate stopped

going after a while or I would drop the

club for a month or two pick it back up

drop it again

how moving forward to high school to

high school high school was a disaster

for disaster Oh talk about that

teachers were all on my case it's like I

was barely there how are you even that

upset with me how are they upset with

you um you know they were always talking

about how I was not taking school

seriously how I had disrespectful

attitude and well I really I guess I

really didn't have to deal with it that

long I was expelled in the 11th grade

that the highest grade did you well

right now we're trying to work on the

GED my GED and how does that come it

goes I guess

I have to get it so I'm not happy about

it not happy there you have to get it

yeah

but you feel like you're able to get it

I think so me I know I'm smarter I just

choose not to do anything with it

all right do you have it any special

training for work not really all my jobs

and they kind of like retail jobs hmm

but I was fired from my first job for

just not showing up how old were you

then my first job when I was 17 and my

first job chef store I got really it

really into partying mm-hmm I just

stopped going after a while just called

and said you're no longer employed here

it's like that's fine um I take it job I

got into a really big argument with a

customer then I quit because I just

couldn't deal with it anymore

that's your first job in your second job

it's a first job fired second shell quit

yeah it's too much stress how about

moving forward there um well now I work

at a warehouse so I have to talk to

people and they have a bunch of days

where like personal days where if I just

if I party a little too much one day I

call out they'll take out my personal

days and it'll be fine

so sounds like you like that job okay

meaningless work but pays the bills

meaningless work yeah but financially it

helps yeah yeah okay I want to switch

gears again that's right we've talked a

little about the marijuana and the xanax

are there any other behaviors you

consider yourself kind of repenting

engaged in like for example gambling or

being on the internet a lot any like

that

um I sometimes stay on the Internet to

like really early how early I mean I've

4 a.m. for them at the worst one - no

I'll have work the next day that's where

the personal days come in so depending

bang it up what attracts you about the

Internet why do you think you spend so

much time there well because it's easier

for me to talk to people through the

internet because it's a no I mean I just

you know like the lights above me what's

the deal with them anymore so it's more

like social media that's sure yeah

yeah and I get the scoop on everybody

so that's always interesting do you

consider a problem I mean it does

interfere with my work sometimes I mean

I do get annoyed when I look at the

clock and it's 2:00 in the morning like

oh my god I'm working eight so I want to

switch gears again okay to another area

I want to talk about your sexual history

okay okay okay all right

you mentioned you had boyfriends in the

past okay okay tell me about your sexual

orientation

I am heterosexual intersexual have you

ever been abused sexually ah my father

was accused of it but to be honest it

you don't remember that I was so young

all right do you think it happened

I don't remember a lot of like while he

was around because it was just really

bad how about your drive would you

consider it normal or more of a drive or

less of a dryer than normal

I would say less less of my plate how

long has it been reduced drive for a

while

for a while months years I'd say at

least a year list here alright so I want

to switch gears again and I know you

touched on this earlier on tell me what

your legal history okay alright okay you

mentioned it to you I yeah what happened

there well I was caught with the UI in

possession but they kind of gave me slap

on the wrist if I went to limp a debauch

what is that what you did yep I mean I

stopped going in a row I went like the

first few times but really he's just a

really good boy yeah so other than that

one DUI any other legal history I've

been pretty good at hiding it alright

does dua affect your ability to find

employment keep employment is there any

hard to find like my warehouse job now I

had a friend who worked there who got me

to be you know got me employment there

but if I hadn't had them then I probably

would have got a job

00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,820
okay so you said that when you're at

2
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,190
work you really worry that you're going

3
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,649
to say something stupid yeah that's

4
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:42,160
something that's always on my mind what

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,050
would be so bad about that if you did

6
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,629
say something stupid at work because

7
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,790
people would think I was weird

8
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,280
then what would be so bad if people at

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,030
work thought you are weird they wouldn't

10
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,670
want to be friends of me and what would

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,019
be so bad about that if people that

12
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,420
worked and want to be friends with you

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,360
well I just have no one to talk to your

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,119
work then what would be so bad about

15
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,780
having our to talk to at work that's I

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,570
mean the shoots can go on the whole day

17
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,759
so just be by myself the whole time and

18
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:20,259
what would be so bad about being by

19
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,070
yourself you know for a whole day a

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,619
genero I guess I should be used to it

21
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,160
now I spend a lot of my time by myself

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,160
that must be tough what does that mean

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,229
to you that you spend a lot of time on

24
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,009
your own you know I guess it's just like

25
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,770
I spend so much time by myself that's

26
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,960
kind of like I'm not even worth being

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,640
friends with so it sounds like deep down

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,960
that you think that you're not worth

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,140
being friends with that's quite quite a

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,610
negative belief I mean how much would

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,049
you say that you believe that out of a

32
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,060
hundred if a hundred is where you

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,560
believe it totally in zeros where you

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,990
don't believe it at all yes like ninety

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,210
five hundred when did you start

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,929
believing that uhm I think it was

37
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,620
probably at school yeah and get school

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,470
and what was it about school that that

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,730
made you start to believe that you

40
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,130
weren't worth being friends with just

41
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,390
like quite a lot of things like a

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,180
wouldn't have anyone said at lunch or

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,440
people's birthdays and stuff I wasn't

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,170
invited and you know like I was the last

45
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,579
one picked for teams and stuff like that

46
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,049
and what is it now that makes you think

47
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,720
that that's still true

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,070
I mean it's kind of similar at work

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,520
obviously differences that it's it's

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,220
worked law school but you know but

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,900
people go for drinks and stuff after

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,290
work or after a shoe and I just kind of

53
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,370
excluded a lot of time mm-hmm that

54
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,350
sounds tough and is there anything that

55
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,730
makes you think that it's not true that

56
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,420
that you are worth being friends with I

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,300
guess my friends and family would say I

58
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,800
am like I try to make a lot of time for

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,290
my friends and stuff okay so it sounds

60
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,630
like deep down you have this thought

61
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,040
that you're not worth being friends with

62
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,320
and that started at school when you had

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,450
trouble making friends at school and

64
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,190
that you can't always pick for teams and

65
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,410
that now at work it feels like the same

66
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,630
thing is happening and that you're not

67
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,010
always invited out for drinks with

68
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,230
people after work and that sometimes you

69
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,460
feel that you're excluded from their

70
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,830
social groups but then that's not the

71
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,360
whole story that on the other hand you

72
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,700
are close to family and you do have

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,380
friends who would say that it's not true

74
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,420
that you are with being friends with and

75
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,850
in CBT we do a thing called thought

76
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,590
challenging where when we have these

77
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,660
negative thoughts sometimes we we

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,880
actually put them up to two scrutiny we

79
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,709
weigh up the evidence for and against

80
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,390
them and I like to think of it as

81
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,150
putting the thought on trial could we do

82
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,680
that now where we just actually try and

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,510
weigh up the evidence for and against

84
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,110
that thought a bit more okay okay so if

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,200
I just put two columns here so for and

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,720
against and it sounds like the evidence

87
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,250
for this thought that makes you think

88
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,298
that it is true is there difficulty at

89
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,940
school yeah making friends being picked

90
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,600
for teams and difficulty at work feeling

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,940
excluded sometimes from groups yeah

92
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,570
but actually in this other column we

93
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,970
have that you are close with your family

94
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,230
and that you have some close friends

95
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,870
okay now moving back to this first

96
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,490
column is there anything else that makes

97
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,320
you think it's true that that you're not

98
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,240
worth being friends with oh just like I

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,900
kind of don't go to a lot of stuff and

100
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,070
people have like gatherings and things

101
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,490
and a lot the time I just I don't go and

102
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,180
okay I'll just stay at home don't go to

103
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,310
parties what kind of parties are we

104
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,290
talking like big parties small parties

105
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,560
and mainly big ones and if there's a lot

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
of people there and just find it really

107
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,180
it kind of makes me really anxious so a

108
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,610
lot of the time I just prefer not even

109
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,870
to be in that situation in the first

110
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,570
place okay so you don't go to larger

111
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,300
parties and events okay is there

112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,310
anything else that maybe thinks that it

113
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,960
makes you think that it's not true that

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,190
actually you are worth being friends

115
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,600
with and I mean I guess my friends would

116
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,070
say that I was and I do I do have close

117
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,160
friends and you know and it's like their

118
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,440
stuff that's important to them I always

119
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,990
make sure that I think about that and

120
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,110
even if I find it stressful I'll always

121
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,060
make sure that I can kind of put them

122
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,720
first okay so your friends would say

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,220
that you are worth being friends with

124
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,860
yeah and it sounds like you put your

125
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,220
friends first yeah I do make sure I try

126
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,470
I try and do that and what kind of ways

127
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,610
do you put your friends first and I

128
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,490
guess when it's birthdays or in it

129
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,580
something important to them um I'll

130
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,170
always make sure that I'm there and that

131
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,080
I put a lot of thought into presents and

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,210
stuff like that can you give me an

133
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,590
example of a time that you've done that

134
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,900
and it was my friend's birthday a few

135
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,660
weeks ago and we did like a big surprise

136
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,630
at hers and I made a cake and stuff like

137
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,150
that so so you actually helped to

138
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,250
organize events for your friends yeah

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,600
is there anything that you do that you

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
wouldn't do if you weren't a good friend

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,700
and I guess so I kind of always put

142
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,040
myself in situations even if I find it

143
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,470
kind of it makes me anxious if it's for

144
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,180
my close friends and I know that is

145
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,800
something that's important to them then

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,020
I'll always put them first and make sure

147
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,710
I'm there

148
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,750
so you'll tolerate your anxiety if it

149
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
means something to a friend of yours

150
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,710
yeah okay so at the moment in the four

151
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,810
category we've got that you had

152
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,090
difficulty making friends at school that

153
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,620
you're having difficulty now at work

154
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,510
making friends and then you don't go to

155
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,180
larger parties or events but actually

156
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,070
there's a lot of evidence in the against

157
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,390
column evidence that would suggest that

158
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,650
actually you are worth being friends

159
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,570
with and you're a good friend that

160
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,860
you're close with your family you're

161
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,750
close with your friends your friends

162
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,010
would say that you're a good friend

163
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,770
you put your friends first and even when

164
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,660
you're anxious you tolerate that anxiety

165
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,580
if you know it'll mean something to them

166
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,830
that when things are important to your

167
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,230
friends like birthdays and you'll make a

168
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,150
real effort you'll even actually go to

169
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,860
the effort of organizing events and

170
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,540
baking cakes and doing things like that

171
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,270
for other people and is there anything

172
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,740
else that you do that makes you think

173
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,360
that maybe you are a good friend you are

174
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,690
worth being friends with I mean I still

175
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,419
have my friends so I guess if I wasn't

176
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:00,830
worth being friends with though I

177
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,080
wouldn't have these friends I've had

178
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,870
quite quite a long time okay so it

179
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,919
sounds like you've got long-term

180
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,990
friendships as well so you might have

181
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,370
trouble making friends but when you make

182
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,640
them you stick with them yeah okay I was

183
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,810
going to give you this list now to have

184
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,860
a look at okay

185
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,800
how do you feel now that you're looking

186
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,860
at that list and it's weird there's

187
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,390
actually kind of more stuff in the

188
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,870
against and there is in the for I guess

189
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,020
also love the stuff that is in the four

190
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
columns kind of things that I make

191
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,520
happen like I don't go to things hmmm

192
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,900
yeah it seems like some of its kind of

193
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,270
in my in my hands so it's not that

194
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,890
you're not worth being friends with but

195
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,480
actually that you're choosing not to

196
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,420
engage with people always yeah yeah I

197
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,120
think so yeah okay and if I was asking

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,950
now you know this idea that you're not

199
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,290
worth being friends with how much do you

200
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,430
believe that now that we've done this

201
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,430
exercise where 100 is where you really

202
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,450
believe that you're not worth being

203
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,130
friends with in zeros that you don't

204
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,980
believe it um I guess I'd say maybe 40 I

205
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,400
think I do still think that it might be

206
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,100
true but I think I believe it less than

207
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,760
I did before","okay so you said that when you're at

work you really worry that you're going

to say something stupid yeah that's

something that's always on my mind what

would be so bad about that if you did

say something stupid at work because

people would think I was weird

then what would be so bad if people at

work thought you are weird they wouldn't

want to be friends of me and what would

be so bad about that if people that

worked and want to be friends with you

well I just have no one to talk to your

work then what would be so bad about

having our to talk to at work that's I

mean the shoots can go on the whole day

so just be by myself the whole time and

what would be so bad about being by

yourself you know for a whole day a

genero I guess I should be used to it

now I spend a lot of my time by myself

that must be tough what does that mean

to you that you spend a lot of time on

your own you know I guess it's just like

I spend so much time by myself that's

kind of like I'm not even worth being

friends with so it sounds like deep down

that you think that you're not worth

being friends with that's quite quite a

negative belief I mean how much would

you say that you believe that out of a

hundred if a hundred is where you

believe it totally in zeros where you

don't believe it at all yes like ninety

five hundred when did you start

believing that uhm I think it was

probably at school yeah and get school

and what was it about school that that

made you start to believe that you

weren't worth being friends with just

like quite a lot of things like a

wouldn't have anyone said at lunch or

people's birthdays and stuff I wasn't

invited and you know like I was the last

one picked for teams and stuff like that

and what is it now that makes you think

that that's still true

I mean it's kind of similar at work

obviously differences that it's it's

worked law school but you know but

people go for drinks and stuff after

work or after a shoe and I just kind of

excluded a lot of time mm-hmm that

sounds tough and is there anything that

makes you think that it's not true that

that you are worth being friends with I

guess my friends and family would say I

am like I try to make a lot of time for

my friends and stuff okay so it sounds

like deep down you have this thought

that you're not worth being friends with

and that started at school when you had

trouble making friends at school and

that you can't always pick for teams and

that now at work it feels like the same

thing is happening and that you're not

always invited out for drinks with

people after work and that sometimes you

feel that you're excluded from their

social groups but then that's not the

whole story that on the other hand you

are close to family and you do have

friends who would say that it's not true

that you are with being friends with and

in CBT we do a thing called thought

challenging where when we have these

negative thoughts sometimes we we

actually put them up to two scrutiny we

weigh up the evidence for and against

them and I like to think of it as

putting the thought on trial could we do

that now where we just actually try and

weigh up the evidence for and against

that thought a bit more okay okay so if

I just put two columns here so for and

against and it sounds like the evidence

for this thought that makes you think

that it is true is there difficulty at

school yeah making friends being picked

for teams and difficulty at work feeling

excluded sometimes from groups yeah

but actually in this other column we

have that you are close with your family

and that you have some close friends

okay now moving back to this first

column is there anything else that makes

you think it's true that that you're not

worth being friends with oh just like I

kind of don't go to a lot of stuff and

people have like gatherings and things

and a lot the time I just I don't go and

okay I'll just stay at home don't go to

parties what kind of parties are we

talking like big parties small parties

and mainly big ones and if there's a lot

of people there and just find it really

it kind of makes me really anxious so a

lot of the time I just prefer not even

to be in that situation in the first

place okay so you don't go to larger

parties and events okay is there

anything else that maybe thinks that it

makes you think that it's not true that

actually you are worth being friends

with and I mean I guess my friends would

say that I was and I do I do have close

friends and you know and it's like their

stuff that's important to them I always

make sure that I think about that and

even if I find it stressful I'll always

make sure that I can kind of put them

first okay so your friends would say

that you are worth being friends with

yeah and it sounds like you put your

friends first yeah I do make sure I try

I try and do that and what kind of ways

do you put your friends first and I

guess when it's birthdays or in it

something important to them um I'll

always make sure that I'm there and that

I put a lot of thought into presents and

stuff like that can you give me an

example of a time that you've done that

and it was my friend's birthday a few

weeks ago and we did like a big surprise

at hers and I made a cake and stuff like

that so so you actually helped to

organize events for your friends yeah

is there anything that you do that you

wouldn't do if you weren't a good friend

and I guess so I kind of always put

myself in situations even if I find it

kind of it makes me anxious if it's for

my close friends and I know that is

something that's important to them then

I'll always put them first and make sure

I'm there

so you'll tolerate your anxiety if it

means something to a friend of yours

yeah okay so at the moment in the four

category we've got that you had

difficulty making friends at school that

you're having difficulty now at work

making friends and then you don't go to

larger parties or events but actually

there's a lot of evidence in the against

you're close with your family you're

I you know I don't even know if this is

something I should be bothering you with

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,239
try me my son is really struggling he's

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,030
he's Josh he's basically living in our

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,130
basement and I know that's what kids

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,170
that age do he's like 20 to do now but

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,710
he's really you know he's not doing well

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,770
he's not eating sleeping he I don't even

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,970
know if he's talking to his girlfriend

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,450
anymore yeah and it's that it's that

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,920
whole kind of you know transition for

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,860
university transition into jobs and you

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,470
know he had an internship but it didn't

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,940
go anywhere we were really hoping that

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,680
he would be able to get this job and now

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,710
it's just slowly gone down here so how

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,320
long since Josh finished his internship

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,140
it was the end of the summer we really

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,659
hoped that it would continue they'd pick

27
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,609
him up for something else but looking

28
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,130
back now yeah when was the first inkling

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,560
of worry for you about how he's doing

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,049
probably around Thanksgiving actually

31
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,659
probably in the fall he he usually gets

32
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,069
together with friends he usually goes

33
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,960
out you know a couple of times and he

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,539
was just not he was you know it's come

35
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,649
to a point where he doesn't even come

36
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:36,969
out of the basement he doesn't have to

37
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:37,929
come out of the basement everything's

38
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,520
down there except the food but I mean

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,369
right it's like that it's and do you

40
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,729
have any kind of communication not

41
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,280
effective he snaps at me so when I ask

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,709
him what's going on it's you know none

43
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:51,369
of my business

44
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,950
get out of his hair it's like he's 14

45
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,259
again you know so I'm sort of worried

46
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,319
I'm thinking he needs to see you but I

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,569
have no idea how to make that happen

48
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,149
what's your worst fear about what's

49
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,209
going on with Josh well that he really

50
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,209
is depressed that he really is in a

51
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,330
place well I don't and I don't know what

52
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,040
that is I I don't know what that is I

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,090
don't know what he's thinking I don't

54
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,540
know and I can't get to him I can't

55
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,090
can't reach I can't reach him and who's

56
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,569
got the best connection

57
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,560
Josh I would like to say I do but I mean

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,969
I think there are things that his dad

59
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,139
talks to him about that

60
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:33,819
you know he's closer with his dad about

61
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,139
of course it's hard for me to know

62
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,329
exactly what's going on with Josh

63
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,519
without having a chance to talk with him

64
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,909
myself right right but you're worried

65
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,010
that he's depressed yeah that's that's

66
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,389
the bottom line I'm worried that there's

67
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,310
really something are you worried that

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,200
he's depressed to the point of thinking

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,359
about killing himself but you're worried

70
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,459
that he's depressed yeah that's that's

71
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:59,810
the bottom line I'm worried that there's

72
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,730
really something are you worried that

73
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,379
he's depressed to the point of thinking

74
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,230
about killing himself

75
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,810
no I don't know it has crossed my mind I

76
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,040
mean it's sort of why I'm here it's

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,650
reached a point now where I don't even

78
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,849
know if he's having showers like I don't

79
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,549
know right so it's like that yeah yeah

80
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:19,099
do you ever hear him talking out loud

81
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,939
when there's no one else there no no no

82
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,439
unless he's screaming at the television

83
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,510
I think it's you know but I don't know

84
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,069
what's going on we're not welcome down

85
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:30,169
there we're just not when he emerges

86
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,870
though is does he look different

87
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,150
he looks disheveled he looks as he lost

88
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,530
weight yeah okay so the most important

89
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,959
thing is gonna be figuring out with you

90
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,090
and with your husband together mm-hmm

91
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,060
we need to strategize on how we can get

92
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,530
Josh to come in and talk with me right

93
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,500
and I think that's gonna work better if

94
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,810
I see you and your husband together and

95
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,280
we put our heads together to figure out

96
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,870
a solution because I understand why

97
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,150
you're worried yeah and it's right to be

98
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,359
worried but we're gonna have to figure

99
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,310
out a way to connect with Josh","miss Spencer hi nice to see you again

it's it's been a while since I've seen

you

yeah yes I think not since your last

general check oh yeah last year okay

well it's nice to see you again but tell

me what brings you in um mm-hmm

I you know I don't even know if this is

something I should be bothering you with

try me my son is really struggling he's

he's Josh he's basically living in our

basement and I know that's what kids

that age do he's like 20 to do now but

he's really you know he's not doing well

he's not eating sleeping he I don't even

know if he's talking to his girlfriend

anymore yeah and it's that it's that

whole kind of you know transition for

university transition into jobs and you

know he had an internship but it didn't

go anywhere we were really hoping that

he would be able to get this job and now

it's just slowly gone down here so how

long since Josh finished his internship

it was the end of the summer we really

hoped that it would continue they'd pick

him up for something else but looking

back now yeah when was the first inkling

of worry for you about how he's doing

probably around Thanksgiving actually

probably in the fall he he usually gets

together with friends he usually goes

out you know a couple of times and he

was just not he was you know it's come

to a point where he doesn't even come

out of the basement he doesn't have to

come out of the basement everything's

down there except the food but I mean

right it's like that it's and do you

have any kind of communication not

effective he snaps at me so when I ask

him what's going on it's you know none

of my business

get out of his hair it's like he's 14

again you know so I'm sort of worried

I'm thinking he needs to see you but I

have no idea how to make that happen

what's your worst fear about what's

going on with Josh well that he really

is depressed that he really is in a

place well I don't and I don't know what

that is I I don't know what that is I

don't know what he's thinking I don't

look headaches and it's just let's try

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,799
to figure some of this out okay when you

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,180
said you were throwing up blood were you

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,299
throwing up bright red blood

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,259
and was it like little spots big spots

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,479
it was

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,280
it was almost filling the toilet it

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
wasn't that much I wasn't like but it

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,580
was enough that I could see it in the

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,560
toilet when I was throwing up and did

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
did you have any other symptoms

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
well I was feeling sick so and I had

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,060
headaches and I you know I've got yeah

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,280
what time of day was this

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,100
I have headaches a lot throughout the

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,899
day but it's throwing up the blood that

39
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,840
was um in the morning and then again

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,939
um the other time it was sort of later

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,979
in the day but I

42
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,899
you know I also wake up in the middle of

43
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,579
the night like and I'm just covered in

44
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,460
sweat I know that's another cancer thing

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,079
well look I can understand why you're

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,119
worried all right because throwing up

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,899
blood is scary and waking up soaked in

48
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,060
sweat in the middle of the night that

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,160
doesn't feel right either let me ask you

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,538
a couple of questions that might help

51
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,360
explain things when did you have your

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
last drink

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
um

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
actually just before I came here okay so

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
that was earlier this morning

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,400
all right what did you have

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
uh I had orange juice and I had some

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,220
vodka in it it's the only thing actually

59
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,800
that like steadies me enough to get out

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,480
the door I don't I don't go out that

61
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,220
often but you know

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,319
so tell me how it helps you

63
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,180
it just steadies me it studies me like

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm you know I'm shaky all the time I'm

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,800
just like so over the course of a day in

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
order to steady yourself in order to

67
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,060
feel calmer how many drinks do you end

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,420
up having

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
pies Maybe singles or doubles

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,860
I don't measure I think so is it mainly

71
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,239
vodka

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,280
sometimes if I'm I'm feeling really like

73
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,780
my stomach is really upset I'll drink

74
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,540
cider so that's it's cider or vodka

75
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,340
because

76
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,720
and you ever get that feeling in the

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,540
morning that some people describe that

78
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,819
they wake up feeling so edgy they need a

79
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,819
drink to calm down yeah it's like the

80
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,319
only thing that works for me it's the

81
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,420
only thing that works to so in the past

82
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,860
week do you think you've been drinking

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,780
more

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,519
um

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,920
in the last week

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,340
not so much maybe less a couple of weeks

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,400
maybe has it been daily oh

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,159
yeah right so the longest you've gone

89
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,680
without a drink in the last month would

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,220
be Hollow

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,140
I don't know actually I mean I I don't

92
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,819
know I've got you know I've got a lot

93
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,540
going on right yeah so my my sister is

94
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,120
in Boston she's got cancer and I know

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,860
like I should be calling her and I can't

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,140
do that my mom is really sick and she's

97
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,659
horrible and I'm the only one who can go

98
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,280
see her and

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,040
I go see my mother and she just yells

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
and screams at me and she's got

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,560
emphysema and it's just

102
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,659
and so for all of those things the

103
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,099
alcohol helps

104
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,720
yeah yeah

105
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
and does it ever happen sort of by the

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,540
end of the day that you have trouble the

107
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,940
next day remembering what happened

108
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,759
I guess I mean I you know my days don't

109
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,160
differ that much but I you know I'll

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,479
fall asleep in front of the television

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,780
and then right like I'm not seeing lots

112
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,280
of people so I you know there's not big

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,479
events in my life that I would be

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,040
remembering I just you know and

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,320
especially now that I'm feeling so not

116
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,139
well that I

117
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,720
yeah there's not much that I would have

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,900
to remember have you tried at all to cut

119
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,600
down on your drinking

120
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
I did I did

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,840
um

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,900
you know I had a boyfriend who

123
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,340
um

124
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,520
you know was sort of casual coming over

125
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,660
and we and he he basically said he

126
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,400
couldn't be with me anymore because I

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,460
drank too much and so I tried at that

128
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,400
point I tried to I was like well yeah

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,500
and then he left so who cares right I

130
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,820
mean right

131
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,199
but have you found yourself feeling

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,000
feeling guilty about the alcohol

133
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,460
I feel guilty about my sister right I

134
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,020
feel guilty that I can't like I just

135
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,220
can't

136
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,759
I can't even call her like I can't

137
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,039
right so

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,620
if I if I could pull it together then I

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,300
could because what I understand from

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,560
what you're telling me

141
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,259
is that the drinking helps meet a

142
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,660
certain need for you in terms of trying

143
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,280
to hold things together with all this

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,800
stuff going on and it meets a need in

145
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,380
terms of trying to keep you calmer but

146
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,720
at the same time it's getting you into

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,759
trouble it's getting into trouble in

148
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,340
terms of relationships but it's also the

149
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,800
most likely explanation for why you've

150
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,620
been throwing up blood isn't why the lab

151
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,680
results that I've got are consistent

152
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
with an amount of alcohol that's too

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,660
much for your body to handle really

154
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,919
really

155
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,900
and that means

156
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,759
ideally that we're going to work

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,620
together to find a way to do something

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,160
about it","hi Ms Watson nice to see you again Dr

Goldblum nice to see you I'm glad you

came back in I've got the results now of

the blood work that we did after your

checkup okay and before we go over any

of that I really wanted to find out from

you how things are going and what you're

concerned about

well I mean I'm I'm I'm curious about

them because I'm I haven't been very

well right I haven't been feeling very

well I've been well last week I threw up

some blood is that the first time that's

happened

yeah the first time I mean I I threw up

blood last week and then

again yesterday so there's something bad

going on I know there's something bad

going on what do you think is going on

what cancer right I think I probably

have cancer I'm not I'm not doing very

well I

look headaches and it's just let's try

to figure some of this out okay when you

said you were throwing up blood were you

throwing up bright red blood

and was it like little spots big spots

it was

it was almost filling the toilet it

wasn't that much I wasn't like but it

was enough that I could see it in the

toilet when I was throwing up and did

did you have any other symptoms

well I was feeling sick so and I had

headaches and I you know I've got yeah

what time of day was this

I have headaches a lot throughout the

day but it's throwing up the blood that

was um in the morning and then again

um the other time it was sort of later

in the day but I

you know I also wake up in the middle of

the night like and I'm just covered in

sweat I know that's another cancer thing

well look I can understand why you're

worried all right because throwing up

blood is scary and waking up soaked in

sweat in the middle of the night that

doesn't feel right either let me ask you

a couple of questions that might help

explain things when did you have your

last drink

um

actually just before I came here okay so

that was earlier this morning

all right what did you have

uh I had orange juice and I had some

vodka in it it's the only thing actually

that like steadies me enough to get out

the door I don't I don't go out that

often but you know

so tell me how it helps you

it just steadies me it studies me like

I'm you know I'm shaky all the time I'm

just like so over the course of a day in

order to steady yourself in order to

feel calmer how many drinks do you end

up having

pies Maybe singles or doubles

I don't measure I think so is it mainly

vodka

sometimes if I'm I'm feeling really like

my stomach is really upset I'll drink

cider so that's it's cider or vodka

because

and you ever get that feeling in the

morning that some people describe that

they wake up feeling so edgy they need a

drink to calm down yeah it's like the

only thing that works for me it's the

only thing that works to so in the past

week do you think you've been drinking

more

um

in the last week

not so much maybe less a couple of weeks

maybe has it been daily oh

yeah right so the longest you've gone

without a drink in the last month would

be Hollow

I don't know actually I mean I I don't

know I've got you know I've got a lot

going on right yeah so my my sister is

in Boston she's got cancer and I know

like I should be calling her and I can't

do that my mom is really sick and she's

horrible and I'm the only one who can go

see her and

I go see my mother and she just yells

and screams at me and she's got

emphysema and it's just

and so for all of those things the

alcohol helps

yeah yeah

and does it ever happen sort of by the

end of the day that you have trouble the

next day remembering what happened

I guess I mean I you know my days don't

differ that much but I you know I'll

fall asleep in front of the television

and then right like I'm not seeing lots

of people so I you know there's not big

events in my life that I would be

remembering I just you know and

especially now that I'm feeling so not

well that I

yeah there's not much that I would have

to remember have you tried at all to cut

down on your drinking

I did I did

um

you know I had a boyfriend who

um

you know was sort of casual coming over

and we and he he basically said he

couldn't be with me anymore because I

drank too much and so I tried at that

point I tried to I was like well yeah

and then he left so who cares right I

mean right

but have you found yourself feeling

feeling guilty about the alcohol

I feel guilty about my sister right I

feel guilty that I can't like I just

can't

I can't even call her like I can't

right so

if I if I could pull it together then I

could because what I understand from

what you're telling me

is that the drinking helps meet a

certain need for you in terms of trying

to hold things together with all this

stuff going on and it meets a need in

terms of trying to keep you calmer but

at the same time it's getting you into

trouble it's getting into trouble in

terms of relationships but it's also the

most likely explanation for why you've

been throwing up blood isn't why the lab

results that I've got are consistent

with an amount of alcohol that's too

much for your body to handle really

really

and that means

ideally that we're going to work

together to find a way to do something

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,740
at least I doing today I'm good but um

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,930
that has been visual you know we've been

3
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,860
working on like my motivation sure kind

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,829
of it's kind of related to that um so

5
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:30,099
I'm in school and every few weeks we

6
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,220
have like papers to write and good I

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,800
know I know what they know we can do it

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,050
it's just actually sitting down and

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,360
doing it all right well tell me about

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,850
the papers well they're usually about

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,789
five pages long and I just like just

12
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:48,399
look at it like it's five pages but I'm

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,379
like okay so I go sit down you know my

14
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,670
computer I'm like all right most armed

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,489
references hmm so I get I think I

16
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,129
started off good I I do the references

17
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,760
but then it's like I get sidetracked so

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,039
easily and then I end up killing like

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,000
two hours checking the news checking and

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,200
then it goes to my phone and then just

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,789
looking up recipes and make its really

22
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,340
off topic and then I realized you know I

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,540
haven't done anything all right so you

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,340
you have a five page paper you sit down

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,030
to work on it you have the references

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,100
you get that part taken care of but that

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,110
sounds like you kind of wander off a

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,290
little bit I'll big time yeah okay and

29
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,350
then what happens after you are done

30
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,110
wondering a little bit well I get kind

31
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,570
of a new annoyed with it and I'm like

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,759
well you know I've already you know it's

33
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,860
already night time i'll try to do it

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,409
tomorrow then you know either tomorrow

35
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,360
doesn't happen or the same thing happens

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
and it's just and then i end up rushing

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
right at the end oh you know that's due

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,500
tomorrow and i'm getting all these five

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,390
pages on this really hard for me so you

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,159
are you are finishing the assignment on

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,920
time so the problem isn't lateness no I

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,560
I mean I get it done you get done it's

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,899
just all at the last minute so it's

44
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,739
really the how the time breaks out isn't

45
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,239
working out well for you yeah

46
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,159
you'd rather not be doing it at the last

47
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,939
moment no I mean I I try not to I mean I

48
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:25,340
set time aside to go sit down I'm like

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,079
all right you know we're going to start

50
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,599
on this paper then sidetracked i'm

51
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,530
watching TV I'm my phone on some other

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,099
website so these so these activities

53
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,889
that you're engaging in between when you

54
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,230
start the work and before you start

55
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,180
writing so we gather the references

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,780
before you start writing you said check

57
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,569
an email yeah and other kind of it

58
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,769
sounds like unplanned small activities

59
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,780
yeah I mean there's small things that

60
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,260
keep my attention but it's not where my

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,120
attention needs to go these aren't

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,159
particularly engaging activities like

63
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,530
something you you need to do yeah at

64
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,409
that moment no I mean I look up you know

65
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,569
right I I started one reference and then

66
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,669
who this article looks cool this article

67
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:18,650
you know next thing I'm no no

68
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,079
researching octopuses or something so

69
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,019
like distracted yeah distracting is a

70
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,479
good word and then there's a moment we

71
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,889
kind of catch yourself and realize you

72
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,259
haven't really started writing yeah but

73
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,489
it's like two hours late it's too late

74
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,000
yeah so you're consuming time there all

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,340
right so you have a few different levels

76
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,609
of activity here you have the the paper

77
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,409
which it sounds like you're okay writing

78
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,229
but you're you're maybe not highly

79
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:48,590
motivated to write okay but you seem to

80
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,509
be getting references done okay yeah i

81
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,069
mean i get the reference is done okay

82
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,400
you clicked the material and then the

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,139
writing part that's right that's a

84
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,879
difficult part and then you have these

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,930
behaviors in the middle which you enjoy

86
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,879
doing a little but they're not something

87
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
that I mean they're not something I like

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,409
any on the jumping for joy about it's

89
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:13,879
just something to to procrastinate so I

90
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,039
don't have to do my paper and I don't

91
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,079
think that I you know I'm not like all I

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,459
need to check my email so i don't have

93
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,520
to do my paper its just oh i should

94
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,870
check my email oh i should check my

95
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,370
phone oh i haven't done this

96
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,260
oh it's in this in a while but these

97
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,300
behaviors still fulfill purpose they

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,790
they do delay the writing of the paper

99
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,240
yeah that's true you may not be fully

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,740
aware of that at the moment but then you

101
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,770
kind of become aware that later that

102
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,320
that's the purpose of those behaviors

103
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,630
accomplished yeah was that they kept be

104
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,030
distracted from that's true I'm writing

105
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,460
alright so the the writing and papers

106
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,490
and activity that that's a behavior

107
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,440
that's something you're not really

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,900
looking forward to what's the behavior

109
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,330
that what's an activity that you really

110
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,800
do look forward to that you think about

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,090
and some level engagement is there well

112
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,910
there is this new TV show out that they

113
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,370
just started a new season and I have it

114
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,300
all recorded like 24 episodes but i

115
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,919
can't find time to watch it I'm really

116
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,870
you know I've seen the first season I'm

117
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,330
so interested in it you know I'm can't

118
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,330
wait to see the next one I guess that

119
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,510
that would that's I guess what makes me

120
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,580
really happy right now so so you're

121
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,410
excited about this television show and

122
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,300
you have you have the episodes already

123
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,720
recorded mm-hm and maybe one of the

124
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,990
reasons you can't find a time is because

125
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,110
the time you're using between the two

126
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,750
parts of writing this paper yeah i mean

127
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,300
this paper taken me a lot longer than it

128
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,180
should all right so it's let's try this

129
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,680
when you when you do write the paper

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,020
you're really writing it the writing

131
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,550
part not the preparing part but the

132
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,800
writing part kind of all at the end

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,810
right dad I'm it's the night before it's

134
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,780
due yeah alright so I want to try a

135
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,370
couple different behavioral strategies

136
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,590
here okay and these might be similar to

137
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,449
what we tried before working with

138
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,400
motivation

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,139
one is I think that it might be helpful

140
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,000
and I want you let me know if I'm right

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,270
here to break if it's a five page paper

142
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,870
to break it up into more than one night

143
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,750
because right now functionally at least

144
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,800
a lot of it you're doing on the last

145
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,240
night what would be a more comfortable

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,789
pace like for example how long does it

147
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:46,909
take you to write one page per hour and

148
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,520
a half all right so around an hour to an

149
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
hour and a half you can complete one

150
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,110
page edited proof read yeah okay so it

151
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,800
would take about five days for you to

152
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,069
complete the whole paper if you did an

153
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,810
hour and a half each day and average

154
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,969
what I have to check okay how much time

155
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,259
do you have from when the papers are

156
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,650
signed to when it's due uh they give us

157
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,770
about we can have to do ok so around 10

158
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,599
days yeah so if you could maintain the

159
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,919
pace of an hour to an hour a half a day

160
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,880
you would be done in plenty of time is

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,289
there a good time to write like to start

162
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,190
writing um I guess around six o'clock

163
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,949
like oh cuz then I'm already done eating

164
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,380
home from work and kind of distressed

165
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,159
already 6 o'clocks good pretty good time

166
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,650
so if you could work without distraction

167
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,110
you would be done by around seven-thirty

168
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,340
at the latest with this one page yeah

169
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,469
with the one page ok so no distractions

170
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,710
are just one page or all right so let's

171
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,940
talk about the the episodes the TV

172
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,009
episodes that you want to watch ok how

173
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,169
long were they there an hour or an hour

174
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,509
ok and once a time that you could watch

175
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,039
those or you get the maximum enjoyment

176
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,379
out of watching would like no

177
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,569
distractions

178
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,759
like this I guess around eight o'clock

179
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,710
cuz that's when I'm you know starting to

180
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,210
get ready for bed I'm starting to like

181
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,389
really relax and you know my husband's

182
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,369
home by that time and we can watch it

183
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:33,880
together he loves the show too ok so 8

184
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,589
o'clocks a really good time for you to

185
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,818
maximize what you'll get out of the show

186
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:44,860
the joy Mitchell get out of show so what

187
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,139
I want to do is try to pair these

188
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,170
behaviors together after the behavior of

189
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,810
writing ok right which is not something

190
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,970
that necessarily thrilled about all the

191
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,250
time but you you are getting it done

192
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,740
just not the time schedule like yeah and

193
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,810
the behavior watching a show which you

194
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,930
are a man marries understand that that's

195
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,759
a great you know that's a great

196
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,000
motivator for you and I want to try to

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,519
use it as a motivator kind of like a

198
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,130
reward ok so I'd like you to try to do

199
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,209
is when you start like when you can wear

200
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,819
these papers assigned from the five page

201
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,399
papers pick the five nights that you

202
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,949
want to work on it could be monday thru

203
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,620
friday or whatever works for you ok all

204
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,870
right clearly within the 10-day window

205
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,240
though alright so five days within the

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,569
10-day window do you have to turn it and

207
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:40,000
then set that time a six o'clock is when

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,930
you're going to start because that's a

209
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,610
good time for you to fork right and when

210
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,639
you try to work straight through to

211
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,959
seven or seven-thirty i know that's a

212
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,089
challenge right yeah and when that

213
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,459
period distraction light encroach right

214
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,220
we know that might happen focus on i

215
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,750
really want to watch that show you a

216
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,930
clock just keep thinking about that when

217
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,360
i feel like i'm getting off track yeah

218
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,630
that's sure in a way that's your reward

219
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,850
that's your motivation that's kind of

220
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,230
what you're looking forward to to get

221
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,490
through something that you don't

222
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,240
necessarily enjoy a lot ok you're going

223
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,569
to be using what you do enjoy a lot to

224
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:25,710
help push you through that ok

225
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,850
in the process I hope that the writing

226
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,790
becomes more enjoyable you know we'll

227
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,370
see but whether it does or doesn't you

228
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,480
still want to be able to complete it

229
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,660
yeah and not have to stress right at the

230
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,640
end yeah and not waste that time in the

231
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,890
middle yeah right that's that's really

232
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,630
eating more time than your show takes

233
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,260
really i mean i could mean you're right

234
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,420
i couldn't watch that show with a month

235
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,990
on my waist just doing other things so

236
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,350
the key here is to try to keep is

237
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,990
structured like if that plan I've laid

238
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,000
out works for is that make sense for you

239
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,850
it does okay because we can modify it if

240
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,520
it doesn't try that now and we can

241
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,590
always change it up okay we need to but

242
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,520
I think that does make sense and it

243
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,920
gives you time to finish the paper and I

244
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,330
think it makes it a device into

245
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,150
manageable periods of time okay but the

246
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,970
key is here to start on time six o'clock

247
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,770
and 22 intend to and try to start the

248
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,140
show on time eight o'clock try to keep

249
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,140
that structure so you have the behavior

250
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,420
that's not necessary too excited about

251
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,460
but you kind of have to do at some point

252
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,410
and that show that you're really looking

253
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,140
forward to okay you're gonna pair those

254
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,670
together no I don't see where you got

255
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,150
enough yeah absolutely does this make

256
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,760
sense to you understand kind of yeah you

257
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,540
know that helped me power through and

258
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,170
not do things unrelated by yo think well

259
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,570
if I get this paper done at this page

260
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,080
done I need to watch my show later and I

261
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,460
think that's a that's a helpful way to

262
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,460
think about it and that's that's the the

263
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,320
cognitive part of this so this is a kind

264
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,870
of this is a behavioral strategy because

265
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,250
we talk about these in the past or this

266
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,770
is behavioral strategy the cognitive

267
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,610
pieces when you find yourself wandering

268
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,930
right then you have to detect that and

269
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,700
you I think you have some level

270
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,560
awareness that's happening yeah you have

271
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,900
to detect that and say up I want to

272
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,190
watch my shot we're looking forward to

273
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,210
it okay and that's your motivation to

274
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,250
you move through the paper and then you

275
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,750

287
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,040
sound good yeah all right all right

288
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,600
Thank You Elsie few weeks all right

289
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,470
thank you thanks","at least I doing today I'm good but um

that has been visual you know we've been

working on like my motivation sure kind

of it's kind of related to that um so

I'm in school and every few weeks we

have like papers to write and good I

know I know what they know we can do it

it's just actually sitting down and

doing it all right well tell me about

the papers well they're usually about

five pages long and I just like just

look at it like it's five pages but I'm

like okay so I go sit down you know my

computer I'm like all right most armed

references hmm so I get I think I

started off good I I do the references

but then it's like I get sidetracked so

easily and then I end up killing like

two hours checking the news checking and

then it goes to my phone and then just

looking up recipes and make its really

off topic and then I realized you know I

haven't done anything all right so you

you have a five page paper you sit down

to work on it you have the references

you get that part taken care of but that

sounds like you kind of wander off a

little bit I'll big time yeah okay and

then what happens after you are done

wondering a little bit well I get kind

of a new annoyed with it and I'm like

well you know I've already you know it's

already night time i'll try to do it

tomorrow then you know either tomorrow

doesn't happen or the same thing happens

and it's just and then i end up rushing

right at the end oh you know that's due

tomorrow and i'm getting all these five

pages on this really hard for me so you

are you are finishing the assignment on

time so the problem isn't lateness no I

I mean I get it done you get done it's

just all at the last minute so it's

really the how the time breaks out isn't

working out well for you yeah

you'd rather not be doing it at the last

moment no I mean I I try not to I mean I

set time aside to go sit down I'm like

all right you know we're going to start

on this paper then sidetracked i'm

watching TV I'm my phone on some other

website so these so these activities

that you're engaging in between when you

start the work and before you start

writing so we gather the references

before you start writing you said check

an email yeah and other kind of it

sounds like unplanned small activities

yeah I mean there's small things that

keep my attention but it's not where my

attention needs to go these aren't

particularly engaging activities like

something you you need to do yeah at

that moment no I mean I look up you know

right I I started one reference and then

who this article looks cool this article

you know next thing I'm no no

researching octopuses or something so

like distracted yeah distracting is a

good word and then there's a moment we

kind of catch yourself and realize you

haven't really started writing yeah but

it's like two hours late it's too late

yeah so you're consuming time there all

right so you have a few different levels

of activity here you have the the paper

which it sounds like you're okay writing

but you're you're maybe not highly

motivated to write okay but you seem to

be getting references done okay yeah i

mean i get the reference is done okay

you clicked the material and then the

writing part that's right that's a

difficult part and then you have these

behaviors in the middle which you enjoy

doing a little but they're not something

that I mean they're not something I like

any on the jumping for joy about it's

just something to to procrastinate so I

don't have to do my paper and I don't

think that I you know I'm not like all I

need to check my email so i don't have

to do my paper its just oh i should

check my email oh i should check my

phone oh i haven't done this

oh it's in this in a while but these

behaviors still fulfill purpose they

they do delay the writing of the paper

yeah that's true you may not be fully

aware of that at the moment but then you

kind of become aware that later that

that's the purpose of those behaviors

accomplished yeah was that they kept be

distracted from that's true I'm writing

alright so the the writing and papers

and activity that that's a behavior

that's something you're not really

looking forward to what's the behavior

that what's an activity that you really

do look forward to that you think about

and some level engagement is there well

there is this new TV show out that they

just started a new season and I have it

all recorded like 24 episodes but i

can't find time to watch it I'm really

you know I've seen the first season I'm

so interested in it you know I'm can't

wait to see the next one I guess that

that would that's I guess what makes me

really happy right now so so you're

excited about this television show and

you have you have the episodes already

recorded mm-hm and maybe one of the

reasons you can't find a time is because

the time you're using between the two

parts of writing this paper yeah i mean

this paper taken me a lot longer than it

should all right so it's let's try this

when you when you do write the paper

you're really writing it the writing

part not the preparing part but the

writing part kind of all at the end

right dad I'm it's the night before it's

due yeah alright so I want to try a

couple different behavioral strategies

here okay and these might be similar to

what we tried before working with

motivation

one is I think that it might be helpful

and I want you let me know if I'm right

here to break if it's a five page paper

to break it up into more than one night

because right now functionally at least

a lot of it you're doing on the last

night what would be a more comfortable

pace like for example how long does it

take you to write one page per hour and

a half all right so around an hour to an

hour and a half you can complete one

page edited proof read yeah okay so it

would take about five days for you to

complete the whole paper if you did an

hour and a half each day and average

what I have to check okay how much time

do you have from when the papers are

signed to when it's due uh they give us

about we can have to do ok so around 10

days yeah so if you could maintain the

pace of an hour to an hour a half a day

you would be done in plenty of time is

there a good time to write like to start

writing um I guess around six o'clock

like oh cuz then I'm already done eating

home from work and kind of distressed

already 6 o'clocks good pretty good time

so if you could work without distraction

you would be done by around seven-thirty

at the latest with this one page yeah

with the one page ok so no distractions

are just one page or all right so let's

talk about the the episodes the TV

episodes that you want to watch ok how

long were they there an hour or an hour

ok and once a time that you could watch

those or you get the maximum enjoyment

out of watching would like no

distractions

like this I guess around eight o'clock

cuz that's when I'm you know starting to

get ready for bed I'm starting to like

really relax and you know my husband's

home by that time and we can watch it

together he loves the show too ok so 8

o'clocks a really good time for you to

maximize what you'll get out of the show

the joy Mitchell get out of show so what

I want to do is try to pair these

behaviors together after the behavior of

writing ok right which is not something

that necessarily thrilled about all the

time but you you are getting it done

just not the time schedule like yeah and

the behavior watching a show which you

are a man marries understand that that's

a great you know that's a great

motivator for you and I want to try to

use it as a motivator kind of like a

reward ok so I'd like you to try to do

is when you start like when you can wear

these papers assigned from the five page

papers pick the five nights that you

want to work on it could be monday thru

friday or whatever works for you ok all

right clearly within the 10-day window

though alright so five days within the

10-day window do you have to turn it and

then set that time a six o'clock is when

you're going to start because that's a

good time for you to fork right and when

you try to work straight through to

seven or seven-thirty i know that's a

challenge right yeah and when that

period distraction light encroach right

we know that might happen focus on i

really want to watch that show you a

clock just keep thinking about that when

i feel like i'm getting off track yeah

that's sure in a way that's your reward

that's your motivation that's kind of

what you're looking forward to to get

through something that you don't

necessarily enjoy a lot ok you're going

to be using what you do enjoy a lot to

help push you through that ok

in the process I hope that the writing

becomes more enjoyable you know we'll

see but whether it does or doesn't you

still want to be able to complete it

yeah and not have to stress right at the

end yeah and not waste that time in the

middle yeah right that's that's really

eating more time than your show takes

really i mean i could mean you're right

i couldn't watch that show with a month

on my waist just doing other things so

the key here is to try to keep is

structured like if that plan I've laid

out works for is that make sense for you

it does okay because we can modify it if

it doesn't try that now and we can

always change it up okay we need to but

I think that does make sense and it

gives you time to finish the paper and I

think it makes it a device into

manageable periods of time okay but the

key is here to start on time six o'clock

and 22 intend to and try to start the

show on time eight o'clock try to keep

that structure so you have the behavior

that's not necessary too excited about

but you kind of have to do at some point

and that show that you're really looking

forward to okay you're gonna pair those

together no I don't see where you got

enough yeah absolutely does this make

sense to you understand kind of yeah you

know that helped me power through and

not do things unrelated by yo think well

if I get this paper done at this page

done I need to watch my show later and I

think that's a that's a helpful way to

think about it and that's that's the the

cognitive part of this so this is a kind

of this is a behavioral strategy because

we talk about these in the past or this

is behavioral strategy the cognitive

pieces when you find yourself wandering

right then you have to detect that and

you I think you have some level

awareness that's happening yeah you have

to detect that and say up I want to

watch my shot we're looking forward to

it okay and that's your motivation to

you move through the paper and then you

know what eight o'clock comes

I get to watch my show watch your show

all right that sounds like a plan all

right very good so let's try that for

I'll see you again in roughly two weeks

hi you have a paper a sign between now

and then I actually do you don't so

let's try it with this next paper I'm

happy the one that will be a sign before

I see you again and let's try the five

day and we'll evaluate how it goes and

make any changes if we need to all right

sound good yeah all right all right

Thank You Elsie few weeks all right

thank you thanks

15
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:16,010
I mean I'm feeling angry that the

16
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,800
therapy isn't working like I've been

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,860
saying I'm feeling angry that like I'm

18
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,770
still in the place that I'm in even

19
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,650
though I've been trying I'm like just

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,350
feeling like I'm feeling like pissed in

21
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,010
general you know right so you know I

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,010
understand that you're pissed in general

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,640
but are you angry at me I mean it sounds

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,260
to me my senses here that you're feeling

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,090
angry at me right now if you are I

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,650
really want to know about it well I mean

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,330
I guess there is a part of me that's

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,229
like a little yeah a little angry that

29
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,600
you're not helping me I came as there

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,380
because I wanted to feel better and yeah

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,110
I mean I guess I am feeling angry that

32
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,810
that's not like what I'm getting from

33
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,310
you

34
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,830
that's what I what I'm trying to get so

35
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,740
you know do something really exasperated

36
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,569
to me how does it feel to tell me about

37
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:30,640
this it feels hard I mean it feels hard

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,670
to say that I'm angry it's like not a

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,980
feeling it's not a comfortable thing to

40
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,620
say not a comfortable thing to feel it's

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,000
just like makes me like it's nothing

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,170
just like yeah okay

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,730
so yeah I want to push you too hard but

44
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,410
can you say any more about what you're

45
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,269
what's uncomfortable about this I mean I

46
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,510
do understand that sometimes people come

47
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,150
you know it's not something I would like

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,370
ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry

49
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,120
at them so it feels like I feel like I

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,550
kind of think anxious now I like even

51
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,410
seeing like I don't want you to think I

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,190
just like that it's like your fault

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,890
it just like feels like I'm like that's

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,220
something I'm really not supposed to say

55
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,610
so

56
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,079
I mean part of it it sounds like is

57
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,610
you're concerned that I'm gonna feel

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,579
like you're blaming me

59
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:36,329
yeah I guess I don't want to do that but

60
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,600
yeah yeah but it is hard to feel like

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,459
this I feel like I'm alone in this

62
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,010
therapy that like I've been coming here

63
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,320
and trying and I'm just not like getting

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,340
anything from you okay so that that

65
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,140
sounds really important right it sounds

66
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,799
like you you know it's hard to say this

67
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,000
to me but you

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,910
you're feeling angry of me maybe feeling

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,860
disappointed you're feeling all alone

70
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,050
yeah like you can't even really talk

71
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,840
with me about this yeah feels really

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,370
hard I want to be able to yeah okay all

73
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,130
right I'm really glad that you know that

74
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,510
we're talking about this in you're able

75
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,810
to tell me more are you feeling the

76
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,410
bubble you know talking about it and I

77
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,669
guess my response right now I mean I'm

78
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,240
still feeling a little anxious but I

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,710
mean I think it's but it feels better

80
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,620
that it's like out there I guess that

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,440
I'd like said it and I think maybe that

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,280
helps

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,470
okay so there's Solis it's out there

84
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,440
okay so maybe we can go from here

85
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,890
you","I know like it's uncomfortable because

it sucks like this therapy is just like

I'm not getting anywhere like it's just

not like doing anything so yeah it's

like it's uncomfortable to talk about

because it looks like my sense is that

you're trying to say something that you

just kind of almost like gave up there

what I'm trying to talk about I don't

know what else like you want me to do I

told you that I'm not gonna like I'm

getting something out for therapy like I

feel like I'm being pretty clear but I

guess I not are you feeling angry at me

I mean I'm feeling angry that the

therapy isn't working like I've been

saying I'm feeling angry that like I'm

still in the place that I'm in even

though I've been trying I'm like just

feeling like I'm feeling like pissed in

general you know right so you know I

understand that you're pissed in general

but are you angry at me I mean it sounds

to me my senses here that you're feeling

angry at me right now if you are I

really want to know about it well I mean

I guess there is a part of me that's

like a little yeah a little angry that

you're not helping me I came as there

because I wanted to feel better and yeah

I mean I guess I am feeling angry that

that's not like what I'm getting from

you

that's what I what I'm trying to get so

you know do something really exasperated

to me how does it feel to tell me about

this it feels hard I mean it feels hard

to say that I'm angry it's like not a

feeling it's not a comfortable thing to

say not a comfortable thing to feel it's

just like makes me like it's nothing

just like yeah okay

so yeah I want to push you too hard but

can you say any more about what you're

what's uncomfortable about this I mean I

do understand that sometimes people come

you know it's not something I would like

ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry

at them so it feels like I feel like I

kind of think anxious now I like even

seeing like I don't want you to think I

just like that it's like your fault

it just like feels like I'm like that's

something I'm really not supposed to say

so

I mean part of it it sounds like is

you're concerned that I'm gonna feel

like you're blaming me

yeah I guess I don't want to do that but

yeah yeah but it is hard to feel like

this I feel like I'm alone in this

therapy that like I've been coming here

and trying and I'm just not like getting

anything from you okay so that that

sounds really important right it sounds

like you you know it's hard to say this

to me but you

you're feeling angry of me maybe feeling

disappointed you're feeling all alone

yeah like you can't even really talk

with me about this yeah feels really

hard I want to be able to yeah okay all

right I'm really glad that you know that

we're talking about this in you're able

to tell me more are you feeling the

bubble you know talking about it and I

guess my response right now I mean I'm

still feeling a little anxious but I

mean I think it's but it feels better

that it's like out there I guess that

I'd like said it and I think maybe that

helps

okay so there's Solis it's out there

okay so maybe we can go from here

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,580
hi Jackie I drove today okay how about

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,510
you I'm doing well thanks for asking I

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,350
understand you've been having some

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,619
difficulties recently that have brought

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,670
you into the agency

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,550
yeah I'm recently married and so my

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,420
husband and I moved in together and up

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,780
until then I I've lived by myself like

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,739
so apparently the craziest things have

10
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,239
been happening while they've been

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,220
sleeping several several nights I've

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,870
woken him up screaming I'm screaming

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,900
Mary over proof in preventing or

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,559
so that's a little alarming to him and

15
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,830
I've even you know been hitting him in

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,160
the middle of the night he's waking up

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,570
with these huge bruises on his arms and

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,610
so yeah apparently my behavior in the

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,470
middle of the night is oh I'm paying it

20
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
so I can understand why that would be

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,470
distressing have you seen a physician

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,100
about this yes I participated in a sleep

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,680
study and what they say they have ruled

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,020
out some some other things and thought

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,900
that maybe it was a behavior sleep

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,950
disorder so they referred me to you I'm

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,570
still working with them now they're

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,550
still running some tests and everything

29
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,200
but they thought maybe there are some

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,020
other stressors or underlying things so

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,770
there might be going on so what would

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,280
you like from counseling Colby um well

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,750
I'm just a little worried that it's

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,330
going to affect my marriage and that my

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,520
husband will not be able to deal with it

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,229
so I would just really like to figure

37
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,000
out how to

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,700
now keep my relationship with him

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,300
successful with it so overcome these

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,040
issues fun so after you were yelling

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,450
things or you hit him like you're asleep

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,660
during this time mm-hmm when you wake up

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,440
what's going through your mind then

44
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,820
what's having the worst dream

45
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,209
so those dreams are kind of what he's

46
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,230
telling me or aligning what my behavior

47
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,180
is my dreams are aligning with those so

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,340
you know I don't feel anything it

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,730
doesn't feel like I've been I think I

50
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,990
have fallen out of bed a couple times

51
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,240
looking up but how people do that so I

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,540
didn't really think anything of it then

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,780
I started to wonder yeah a little

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,990
strange

55
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,130
I'm sorry wonder if you didn't have this

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,010
disorder before yeah I mean I would I

57
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,250
wouldn't have known I've lived by myself

58
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,970
but you know I before I had fallen out

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,030
about a couple times and oh my sheets

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,410
and pillows are always everywhere when I

61
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,710
wake up but I didn't really think

62
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,890
kind of making the connections now so

63
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,340
he's been paying attention to what's

64
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,670
going on with your sleep does the

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,700
episode of yelling or moving around does

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,680
it happen in a certain time limit like

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
it happened right after you go to sleep

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,050
or while after you go to sleep um in the

69
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,840
middle of the night he has he said at

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,830
first he thought I was joking around but

71
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,600
know that I am just waking him up you

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,820
like a nap or a short nap no he's he's

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,649
usually around from him you know I don't

75
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,000
coughs napping he says it hasn't

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,510

clinical probability of a PE is high you

24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,239
organize a Doppler ultrasound of the

legs first and once you exclude a DVT

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,520
you consider either a VQ scan or a CT PA

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,340
to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of a

28

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,459
first time I've met you so are you able

55
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,560
to give me a bit of a and talk to me

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,940
about what spot you in here and if you

57
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,530
have any particular concerns or worries

58
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,230
at all and this morning I was just

59
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,870
walking I've been at the supermarket and

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,250
I was walking and I got really really

61
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,959
short of breath really quickly yeah it's

62
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
just a bit scary really okay I mean that

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,500
just happened today or have you been

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,060
feeling out of breath over the past few

65
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,290
days at all and it happened I'd probably

66
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,380
say about two or three days ago

67
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,930
something like that okay so I'm really

68
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,579
short of breath quite right

69
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,320
and any other symptoms like any pain in

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,880
your chest or any cough at all or no I

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,530
was towed by having a look at your notes

72
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,000
before and that you're pregnant is that

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,920
right yeah how many weeks pregnant I'm

74
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,620
at twelve twelve weeks okay and these

75
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,630
are any big concerns at all with the

76
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,590
pregnancy right okay and all within the

77
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,150
shorts RF any other symptoms you've

78
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,380
noticed no no I don't think like any

79
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,510
swelling in your legs at all or no

80
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,130
anything think a bit sore at the end of

81
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,269
the day I've been doing a lot of walking

82
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,440
around right okay and have you been many

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,900
long distance journey at all recently or

84
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,519
we went on to see family and some us a

85
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,840
few weeks ago

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,470
the car grab back from that was quite

87
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,860
how long was the car ride about we

88
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,440
didn't really stop so probably about six

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,660
or seven hours and you take any

90
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,180
medications or anything no I'm just on

91
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,240
the folic acid in the folic acid okay so

92
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,470
you said over the past few days you've

93
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,910
been getting a bit more out of breath

94
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,270
and you have your 12 weeks pregnant at

95
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,160
the moment yeah you're taking folic acid

96
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
then you also mentioned gives us long

97
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,030
distance journey that you had is there

98
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,470
anything else you think I've missed in

99
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,690
terms of your symptoms or in your oh

100
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,690
sorry no no and another reason why I was

101
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,979
quite frightened this morning just

102
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,090
before it happened I was actually

103
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,729
reading I'm subscribed to this pregnancy

104
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,610
magazine right looking through that and

105
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,870
probably about 20 minutes or so before

106
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,430
app and I was flicking through that and

107
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,400
I was reading about it sometimes and

108
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
like shortness of breath and like that's

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,919
but gonna close by like okay so that's

110
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,090
something you think that it you've read

111
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,400
about you think you panic alert right

112
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,110
and I will talk a bit about that

113
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,550
afterwards my over them that do you have

114
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,320
any other concerns or any specific

115
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
questions you have no okay what I'd like

116
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
to do now just have a bit of a chat

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,110
about what I think could be causing this

118
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,020
and about some of the investigations we

119
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,430
might need to do some of the treatments

120
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,160
involved is that okay yes so are you is

121
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,690
saying about in pregnancy in the

122
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,640
magazine you were reading sometimes you

123
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,500
can get close in your body because of

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,729
what happens to your body during

125
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,890
pregnancy it can make your blood a lot

126
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,710
more likely to clot so sometimes people

127
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,300
who get things like clots in their legs

128
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,600
or sometimes clots in the chest and that

129
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,400
can give them symptoms like shortness of

130
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,200
breath if you get a clot in your chest

131
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,150
don't worry sounds obviously didn't

132
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,860
sound very nice to most part in your

133
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,900
body

134
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,610
however they are relatively common

135
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,380
things and they're very treatable as

136
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,930
well which we're going to talk a bit

137
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,900
about afterwards also as I said you re

138
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,310
being pregnant you more at risk of

139
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,039
asking people have had a long time where

140
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,450
they've not been moving around such a

141
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,639
long car journey that can make people

142
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,919
more at risk to these clots which is why

143
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,450
I think this is something we need to

144
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,100
look into we probably need to do a few

145
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,229
foot of a tests to see if this is

146
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:30,940
something like a clot in your body

147
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,470
well there was tests need to be done

148
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,300
tonight

149
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,670
because I've got quite on your boy at

150
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,360
home okay

151
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,540
okay so the test that we do I'll talk in

152
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,460
a second now the issue with this

153
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,860
condition is as I said it's relatively

154
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,270
common it's something that can be

155
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,070
treated if you do have something like a

156
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,090
clots

157
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,850
however they can sometimes be severe and

158
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,860
if they're not treated or investigated

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,010
probably they can develop and can make

160
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,410
people quite unwell and obviously that

161
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,150
could affect your your child as well

162
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,070
your pregnancy if it was to make you

163
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,830
quite unwell also your oxygen levels are

164
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,990
quite low because of that we'd need to

165
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,450
give you oxygen to get your option

166
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,280
levels to a way that - it to a level

167
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,560
that is acceptable and also that would

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,890
be beneficial to your pregnancy so I

169
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,510
think it would be unsafe for you to

170
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,060
leave until we get this sorted because

171
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,400
if we were to delay the treatment or the

172
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,380
investigations that could affect you and

173
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,170
your pregnancy as well and not giving

174
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,640
you watching it well could affect things

175
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,980
is that sound reasonable or is that some

176
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,330
like it's gonna be a problem if you were

177
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,220
to stay with was in hospital for the

178
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,830
next day or so we've got something that

179
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,860
I'm not gonna die on so I get obviously

180
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,150
this book that you came towards early

181
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,980
this is something that is very treatable

182
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,870
if it is a clotting that in the long

183
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,340
term we can give you treatment for it

184
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,410
and the treatment is successful it's

185
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,940
usually you obviously don't know what's

186
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,800
going to happen in the future but this

187
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,390
if it is a cotton along that's a very

188
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,250
successful the treatments very

189
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,440
successful however the main thing is if

190
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
treatment is delayed or if the diagnosis

191
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,700
is delayed that could affect you and

192
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,950
your and your baby and that's obviously

193
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,450
part of the reason why we'll take this

194
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,010
seriously yeah why would we want to keep

195
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,630
you in a hospital to monitor to check

196
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,200
for you know any any complications or

197
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,610
any signs that things could be getting

198
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,120
yeah worse okay yeah your any of you

199
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,920
were specific questions or concerns you

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,610
have for me no I don't think so

201
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,830
just any risk that the tests might have

202
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,840
it wasn't baby so what I'd like to do

203
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,820
now is talk a bit about the tests that

204
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,669
we do what we would do initially is a

205
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,250
scan of your legs as I said these clots

206
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,990
in your mods if you do have a cotton

207
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,460
you're long do you usually develop

208
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,260
because you'd first developed a clotting

209
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,620
your legs in one in the vein

210
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,779
your legs and that can travel to your

211
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,089
lungs so the first test we would do is a

212
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,820
jelly types gum call an ultrasound of

213
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,890
your legs to see if there is a clot that

214
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,770
if there is a clot then we give you the

215
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,000
treatment for the cotton there's no

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,890
further tests we need we need we need to

217
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,260
do however if we don't discover the

218
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,690
clock there we then need to do tests on

219
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,120
your lungs to see if there is a clot on

220
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,890
your walls

221
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,390
the two tests that we might need to do

222
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,480
one is call this they've got fancy names

223
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,300
one is called the C TPA basically means

224
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,970
you go into a scanner cover your baby so

225
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,920
your baby's not affected by the C TPA

226
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,230
and you go into a scanner and they give

227
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,240
you x-rays to see if you do have a clot

228
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,180
in your lungs that's one of the tests

229
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,700
the concern or the issue with that is

230
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,440
that if someone's pregnant because of

231
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,600
the changes to a woman's breasts when

232
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,670
they're pregnant it can give a very very

233
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,400
very small increase of breast cancer

234
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,560
several years later on by emphasized

235
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,170
that's a very very small increased

236
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,380
chance in the future we will see with a

237
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,880
CT PA okay

238
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,430
the number that is about not point seven

239
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,440
percent to increased risks it's very

240
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,500
very very very small increased risk the

241
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,020
alternative mercy TPA is something

242
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,520
called a VQ scan now a VQ scan they give

243
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,940
you a injection and it looks those

244
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,440
various things to see if there is a

245
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,920
clotting along the v teeth the downside

246
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,529
to a VQ scan is that again it's a very

247
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,080
very very small risk but if you're

248
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,910
pregnant they can be a tiny increased

249
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,490
risk of childhood types of cancers with

250
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,040
a VQ scan and as I say that sounds very

251
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,720
horrible it doesn't sound very nice but

252
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,000
these risks the increased risk to your

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
baby of childhood cancers is very small

254
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,570
with a VQ scan or of the CT PA the

255
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,450
increased risk to you of breast cancer

256
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,010
later on this is a very very small

257
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,080
increase risk I know that's a lot of

258
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,360
information I'm giving you is there any

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,650
questions you have or anything that's

260
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,839
not made sense or anything your concern

261
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,400
from what I told you other than

262
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,279
obviously

263
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,709
use that with the CTA there's no risk to

264
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:55,850
my babies

265
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,009
no nervous the baby they cover your baby

266
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,230
so they put I don't know exactly what it

267
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,029
is but it's sort of a board I think it's

268
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,620
a leg board they've got over your tummy

269
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,939
when they do this can so that your

270
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,740
baby's not affected during it yeah how

271
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,170
do they treat it is the treatment

272
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,079
different so the treatment that we that

273
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,970
we give with someone who's pregnant if

274
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,860
you do have if one of these testers

275
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,839
discover you have a clot we give you

276
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,930
injections called heparin or low

277
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,610
molecular weight heparin and they're

278
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,170
these small injections that people

279
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,569
usually give in their tummy what you

280
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,449
want lots of people manage it very very

281
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,490
well and you usually have them maybe

282
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,980
once or twice in a day and you have that

283
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,100
throughout your pregnancy and up to six

284
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,709
weeks six weeks afterwards sometimes

285
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,120
people need to continue along what

286
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,800
usually it's up to six weeks afterwards

287
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,519
would I you be able to go home hospital

288
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,529
no so again this is something if you do

289
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,569
have the clots we would give you the

290
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,699
treatment here and then we can train you

291
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,980
or if you are not happy some people have

292
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,949
concerns about injections something we

293
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,629
can train maybe someone who's close to

294
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,970
you to give you the injections

295
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,639
with the injections that we give you as

296
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,670
I say every injection has mild side

297
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,730
effects but it's to help the clots from

298
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,519
progressing and obviously to have no

299
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,029
negative effects on your baby are there

300
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,800
any other treatment options or is that

301
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,269
so

302
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,009
so with pregnancy this is the one we

303
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,170
choose if you weren't pregnant we

304
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,910
usually start patients on a medication

305
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,800
called a warfarin I don't know if you've

306
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,309
heard of warfarin before at all so it's

307
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,569
just a there's another type of

308
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,490
medication that we give the clots and

309
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,100
the reason we don't give Waffen driven

310
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,860
pregnancy is because warfarin can be

311
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,829
harmful to your baby so that's why we

312
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,959
don't give Waffen to treat clots during

313
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,170
pregnancy we give you these injections

314
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,860
because they won't harm they with how

315
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,130
baby do you have any other questions for

316
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,990
me or anything that's not being macclare

317
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,230
at all or any concerns from what I said

318
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,470
hmm

319
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,260
no just yeah as I say something

320
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,640
understandable I've given you a lot of

321
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,500
information about various things I can

322
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,030
give you some leaflets about some of the

323
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,660
tests that we've talked about and if you

324
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,010
see whilst you're here if you have any

325
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,020
concerns or worries you can write them

326
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,360
down or ask any of the nursing staff or

327
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,550
any other doctors that you see was what

328
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,590
whilst you're here but as I say the main

329
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,870
thing is that what we think you may have

330
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,580
the clotting on that's a relatively

331
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,250
common thing it is treatable and we're

332
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,780
keeping you in hospital and doing the

333
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,240
tests we'll find out what's going on to

334
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,170
do the best that we can for you

335
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,710
developing baby

336
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,600
well then tests be done today what do

337
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,320
you think it depends on and we'll

338
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,530
request the tests and it depends on what

339
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,210
you choose so you don't have to decide

340
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,300
today about the seat EPA or the VQ scan

341
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,740
we can give you some information about

342
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,420
that and depending on what you want to

343
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,790
do if that's needed because we do that

344
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,120
jelly's come first but it's likely that

345
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,790
you will have to wait for a few days or

346
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,430
so until we can do do the tests there's

347
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,030
usually a there's a queue for the tests

348
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,450
and only people who are very very very

349
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,640
unwell and they need it very very

350
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,100
urgently will get the test first so you

351
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,160
will likely end up staying for a day or

352
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,070
so in the hospital okay which treatment

353
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,970
which one would you recommend so again I

354
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,950
wouldn't want to because you're your own

355
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,450
person I won't want to tell you what to

356
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,520
do and you don't need to make a decision

357
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,220
today about the test that you want to

358
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,540
have we can give you some information

359
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,960
about about the risk to your baby of VQ

360
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,270
scan and about the risk to you the CT

361
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,330
scan and help you to make the decisions

362
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,490
with this use of the CT p p CT p a scan

363
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,910
John has more that has a various a bit

364
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,100
better at detecting the clots than the

365
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,140
VQ scan so if you have the CT PA

366
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,730
it is slightly a bit more better

367
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,710
detecting a clot if there is one there

368
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,220
then the VQ scan was a VQ scan can very

369
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,140
rarely sometimes miss a clot that's

370
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,180
there but you have to consider that the

371
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,500
CT PA you you might not want that's

372
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,530
because of the small increased risk to

373
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,990
yourself later in life and again with a

374
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,240
VQ scan you might not want that because

375
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,970
of the small increased risk of childhood

376
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,790
cancers with having that which isn't

377
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,770
easy decision to make but we can help

378
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,010
you with that okay any other questions

379
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:45,150
for me well we talked a lot about today

380
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,560
and as I say if you have any further

381
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,060
questions ask us and Walter wolf

382
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,830
we'll start with the treatment and get

383
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,420
these all these scans organized for you

384
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,340
thank you nice seeing you well I think

385
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,010
right okay so you've seen the patient

386
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,620
you've spoken to her about this

387
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,430
suspected diagnosis of PE would you like

388
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,740
to tell me what principles guided your

389
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,970
discussion your conversation with the

390
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,250
patient please

391
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,870
so my discussion was mainly guided by

392
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,000
the four main principles of core

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,130
principles of medical ethics main one

394
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,080
with this that was relevant was autonomy

395
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,050
was the patient's choice and her right

396
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,900
to choose what's investigation she had

397
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,180
and what treatment she had Urich

398
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,520
principle is beneficence and doing the

399
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,400
right thing for your patients and making

400
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,780
sure that everything that we're doing is

401
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,180
really in the best interests for the

402
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,180
patient and the baby as well and also

403
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,730
non-maleficence is another important

404
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,710
principle and that goes about not doing

405
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,600
any harm and that can be tricky

406
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,130
sometimes beneficence and

407
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,890
non-maleficence they can contradict one

408
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,080
another in a situation or example where

409
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,370
this see TPA would be beneficial or VQ

410
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,680
scan would be Venice it beneficial to

411
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,619
the mother in seen if there was a PE but

412
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,750
it could harm the baby in some way so

413
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,099
there is a balance sometimes between

414
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,119
been

415
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,220
in non-maleficence and the final

416
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,980
principle justice is about treating

417
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,230
people equally and which may not be as

418
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,549
relevant in this situation that's

419
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:19,799
another principle to keep in mind okay

420
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,720
good they'll just come to your first

421
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,140
principle you mentioned autonomy other

422
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,349
than these situations you can think

423
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,049
where you wouldn't give that autonomy to

424
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:31,950
your patient

425
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,980
so autonomy the only time you wouldn't

426
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,809
is if the patient doesn't have capacity

427
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:39,299
and if someone you don't believe they

428
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,190
had capacity there's various reasons for

429
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,620
that you as a doctor would have to do

430
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,000
what is in the best interest of the

431
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,309
patient and that may mean involving

432
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,279
relatives or carers or close family

433
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,649
friends or maybe other healthcare

434
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,330
professionals who have known the patient

435
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,980
for a long time to try and see what is

436
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,929
the best thing to do for that patients

437
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,360
okay let me just ask you a couple of

438
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,270
questions on capacity can you think of

439
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,510
the principles of how you would assess

440
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,570
capacity okay so there were four things

441
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,460
that it number one is that you should

442
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,020
always assume that a patient has

443
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,870
capacity only when you feel they don't

444
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,460
have capacity then then you go and

445
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,470
assess so it's you should assume that

446
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,990
every patient you see has capacity there

447
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,000
are four ways in which someone needs to

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
have to say they do have capacity number

449
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,100
one is that they understand what you're

450
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,750
saying and they accept that as the truth

451
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,450
number two is they can retain that

452
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,070
information they can remember that

453
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,750
information for a reasonable period of

454
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,730
time okay the third one is that they can

455
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,140
weigh that information up to sort it to

456
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,140
make a decision that decision may not be

457
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,240
what you think is appropriate but it's

458
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,130
that they can weigh that information or

459
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,260
to make a balanced decision and the

460
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,340
fourth thing is that they communicate

461
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,429
that decision in some way and if they

462
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,649
have all those four then a patient has a

463
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,690
capacity okay can you think of any

464
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,059
examples where a patient might lack

465
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,539
capacity and so one example is a patient

466
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,240
who may have cognitive impairment such

467
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,340
as an Alzheimer's dementia okay because

468
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,870
of the Alzheimer's dementia their

469
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,240
short-term memory may sorts of memory

470
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,100
may be impaired yeah sorry they may not

471
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,680
be able to reach

472
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
the information you're giving them for a

473
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,310
long enough period of time to weigh that

474
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,380
information on okay so that's one

475
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,670
example where someone may in what

476
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,740
capacity can you think of an example

477
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,040
where they may have a lack of an ability

478
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,860
to communicate so patients who have

479
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,500
strokes sometimes if their speech is

480
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,780
affected or their writing is affected

481
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,940
and sometimes it may be difficult to

482
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,300
communicate in that situation you as a

483
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,710
healthcare professional should do

484
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,110
everything you can to enhance and how

485
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,140
they can communicate so there are visual

486
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,180
aids where people can point to films or

487
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,560
sometimes we've locked-in syndrome

488
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,410
people blink yeah I too community yes

489
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,500
yeah good good okay let me just move on

490
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,970
from your principles of assessment of

491
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,170
capacity on to the treatment and the

492
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,640
investigations that you are offering to

493
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,850
the patient you mentioned about the risk

494
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,660
of breast cancer to the mother how much

495
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,270
did you say was the increased risk so I

496
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,580
believe from the literature the

497
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,470
increased risk for Brad can't resist by

498
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,310
not 0.7 percent so 7 ounce 4,000 is that

499
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,190
the increased risk yes okay okay good

500
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,000
and you said you're going to treat for

501
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,990
the entire duration of a pregnancy which

502
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,480
is going to be like seven seven and a

503
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,820
half months from now positive seven

504
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,120
months and also for six weeks after yes

505
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:54,400
yeah okay so for example you sorry you

506
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,190
decided not to give a war friend hmm

507
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,070
can you think of a reason why we don't

508
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,830
use water because water is teratogenic

509
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,710
they passed the placenta can give it to

510
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,490
a wall Alexandra
","welcome to this communication

skills and ethics station for the MRCP

paces examination I'm just going to read

out the scenario for you for this

scenario you get 14 minutes with the

patient a minute to collect your

thoughts and then five minutes with the

examiner and the patient and scenario

for today you've been called to the

emergency department to see a patient

with 12 weeks pregnant and she's 20

years old herself two weeks ago she has

had a long uninterrupted car journey and

two days ago she has had an episode of

shortness of breath which again happened

today

she has been reading a pregnancy

magazine and has been concerned about

clots on her lungs her oxygen

saturations are 91% but the rest of the

examination and chest x-ray are normal

current guidelines suggest that if the

clinical probability of a PE is high you

organize a Doppler ultrasound of the

legs first and once you exclude a DVT

you consider either a VQ scan or a CT PA

to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of a

PE she is currently only on folic acid

supplementation your task is to explain

what can be done to establish the

diagnosis and what treatment is

appropriate hello hi my name is dr.

honaker is that dr. Agarwal yes that's

me so this is station for communication

skills and ethics for the MRCP paces

examination

right you have read the scenario outside

yep you get 14 minutes with a patient a

minute to collect your thoughts and then

five minutes with the examiner okay I'm

going to give you a warning when two

minutes are left with the patient okay

would you like to proceed okay

hi is it Lauren a tank my name is Senne

Oleg I'm one of the doctors doesn't just

come down here just to have it have a

chat with you can see what we can do to

help you okay and what's your last name

sorry Bradley is it okay if I call you

Lauren yeah that's actually if you just

confirm your date of birth for me yeah

it's 15 for the 698 right so that makes

you 20 years old okay so this is the

first time I've met you so are you able

to give me a bit of a and talk to me

about what spot you in here and if you

have any particular concerns or worries

at all and this morning I was just

walking I've been at the supermarket and

I was walking and I got really really

short of breath really quickly yeah it's

just a bit scary really okay I mean that

just happened today or have you been

feeling out of breath over the past few

days at all and it happened I'd probably

say about two or three days ago

something like that okay so I'm really

short of breath quite right

and any other symptoms like any pain in

your chest or any cough at all or no I

was towed by having a look at your notes

before and that you're pregnant is that

right yeah how many weeks pregnant I'm

at twelve twelve weeks okay and these

are any big concerns at all with the

pregnancy right okay and all within the

shorts RF any other symptoms you've

noticed no no I don't think like any

swelling in your legs at all or no

anything think a bit sore at the end of

the day I've been doing a lot of walking

around right okay and have you been many

long distance journey at all recently or

we went on to see family and some us a

few weeks ago

the car grab back from that was quite

how long was the car ride about we

didn't really stop so probably about six

or seven hours and you take any

medications or anything no I'm just on

the folic acid in the folic acid okay so

you said over the past few days you've

been getting a bit more out of breath

and you have your 12 weeks pregnant at

the moment yeah you're taking folic acid

then you also mentioned gives us long

distance journey that you had is there

anything else you think I've missed in

terms of your symptoms or in your oh

sorry no no and another reason why I was

quite frightened this morning just

before it happened I was actually

reading I'm subscribed to this pregnancy

magazine right looking through that and

probably about 20 minutes or so before

app and I was flicking through that and

I was reading about it sometimes and

like shortness of breath and like that's

but gonna close by like okay so that's

something you think that it you've read

about you think you panic alert right

and I will talk a bit about that

afterwards my over them that do you have

any other concerns or any specific

questions you have no okay what I'd like

to do now just have a bit of a chat

about what I think could be causing this

and about some of the investigations we

might need to do some of the treatments

involved is that okay yes so are you is

saying about in pregnancy in the

magazine you were reading sometimes you

can get close in your body because of

what happens to your body during

pregnancy it can make your blood a lot

more likely to clot so sometimes people

who get things like clots in their legs

or sometimes clots in the chest and that

can give them symptoms like shortness of

breath if you get a clot in your chest

don't worry sounds obviously didn't

sound very nice to most part in your

body

however they are relatively common

things and they're very treatable as

well which we're going to talk a bit

about afterwards also as I said you re

being pregnant you more at risk of

asking people have had a long time where

they've not been moving around such a

long car journey that can make people

more at risk to these clots which is why

I think this is something we need to

look into we probably need to do a few

foot of a tests to see if this is

something like a clot in your body

well there was tests need to be done

tonight

because I've got quite on your boy at

home okay

okay so the test that we do I'll talk in

a second now the issue with this

condition is as I said it's relatively

common it's something that can be

treated if you do have something like a

clots

however they can sometimes be severe and

if they're not treated or investigated

probably they can develop and can make

people quite unwell and obviously that

could affect your your child as well

your pregnancy if it was to make you

quite unwell also your oxygen levels are

quite low because of that we'd need to

give you oxygen to get your option

levels to a way that - it to a level

that is acceptable and also that would

be beneficial to your pregnancy so I

think it would be unsafe for you to

leave until we get this sorted because

if we were to delay the treatment or the

investigations that could affect you and

your pregnancy as well and not giving

you watching it well could affect things

is that sound reasonable or is that some

like it's gonna be a problem if you were

to stay with was in hospital for the

next day or so we've got something that

I'm not gonna die on so I get obviously

this book that you came towards early

this is something that is very treatable

if it is a clotting that in the long

term we can give you treatment for it

and the treatment is successful it's

usually you obviously don't know what's

going to happen in the future but this

if it is a cotton along that's a very

successful the treatments very

successful however the main thing is if

treatment is delayed or if the diagnosis

is delayed that could affect you and

your and your baby and that's obviously

part of the reason why we'll take this

seriously yeah why would we want to keep

you in a hospital to monitor to check

for you know any any complications or

any signs that things could be getting

yeah worse okay yeah your any of you

were specific questions or concerns you

have for me no I don't think so

just any risk that the tests might have

it wasn't baby so what I'd like to do

now is talk a bit about the tests that

we do what we would do initially is a

scan of your legs as I said these clots

in your mods if you do have a cotton

you're long do you usually develop

because you'd first developed a clotting

your legs in one in the vein

your legs and that can travel to your

lungs so the first test we would do is a

jelly types gum call an ultrasound of

your legs to see if there is a clot that

if there is a clot then we give you the

treatment for the cotton there's no

further tests we need we need we need to

do however if we don't discover the

clock there we then need to do tests on

your lungs to see if there is a clot on

your walls

the two tests that we might need to do

one is call this they've got fancy names

one is called the C TPA basically means

you go into a scanner cover your baby so

your baby's not affected by the C TPA

and you go into a scanner and they give

you x-rays to see if you do have a clot

in your lungs that's one of the tests

the concern or the issue with that is

that if someone's pregnant because of

the changes to a woman's breasts when

they're pregnant it can give a very very

very small increase of breast cancer

several years later on by emphasized

that's a very very small increased

chance in the future we will see with a

CT PA okay

the number that is about not point seven

percent to increased risks it's very

very very very small increased risk the

alternative mercy TPA is something

called a VQ scan now a VQ scan they give

you a injection and it looks those

various things to see if there is a

clotting along the v teeth the downside

to a VQ scan is that again it's a very

very very small risk but if you're

pregnant they can be a tiny increased

risk of childhood types of cancers with

a VQ scan and as I say that sounds very

horrible it doesn't sound very nice but

these risks the increased risk to your

baby of childhood cancers is very small

with a VQ scan or of the CT PA the

increased risk to you of breast cancer

later on this is a very very small

increase risk I know that's a lot of

information I'm giving you is there any

questions you have or anything that's

not made sense or anything your concern

from what I told you other than

obviously

use that with the CTA there's no risk to

my babies

no nervous the baby they cover your baby

so they put I don't know exactly what it

is but it's sort of a board I think it's

a leg board they've got over your tummy

when they do this can so that your

baby's not affected during it yeah how

do they treat it is the treatment

different so the treatment that we that

we give with someone who's pregnant if

you do have if one of these testers

discover you have a clot we give you

injections called heparin or low

molecular weight heparin and they're

these small injections that people

usually give in their tummy what you

want lots of people manage it very very

well and you usually have them maybe

once or twice in a day and you have that

throughout your pregnancy and up to six

weeks six weeks afterwards sometimes

people need to continue along what

usually it's up to six weeks afterwards

would I you be able to go home hospital

no so again this is something if you do

have the clots we would give you the

treatment here and then we can train you

or if you are not happy some people have

concerns about injections something we

can train maybe someone who's close to

you to give you the injections

with the injections that we give you as

I say every injection has mild side

effects but it's to help the clots from

progressing and obviously to have no

negative effects on your baby are there

any other treatment options or is that

so

so with pregnancy this is the one we

choose if you weren't pregnant we

usually start patients on a medication

called a warfarin I don't know if you've

heard of warfarin before at all so it's

just a there's another type of

medication that we give the clots and

the reason we don't give Waffen driven

pregnancy is because warfarin can be

harmful to your baby so that's why we

don't give Waffen to treat clots during

pregnancy we give you these injections

because they won't harm they with how

baby do you have any other questions for

me or anything that's not being macclare

at all or any concerns from what I said

hmm

no just yeah as I say something

understandable I've given you a lot of

information about various things I can

give you some leaflets about some of the

tests that we've talked about and if you

see whilst you're here if you have any

concerns or worries you can write them

down or ask any of the nursing staff or

any other doctors that you see was what

whilst you're here but as I say the main

thing is that what we think you may have

the clotting on that's a relatively

common thing it is treatable and we're

keeping you in hospital and doing the

tests we'll find out what's going on to

do the best that we can for you

developing baby

well then tests be done today what do

you think it depends on and we'll

request the tests and it depends on what

you choose so you don't have to decide

today about the seat EPA or the VQ scan

we can give you some information about

that and depending on what you want to

do if that's needed because we do that

jelly's come first but it's likely that

you will have to wait for a few days or

so until we can do do the tests there's

usually a there's a queue for the tests

and only people who are very very very

unwell and they need it very very

urgently will get the test first so you

will likely end up staying for a day or

so in the hospital okay which treatment

which one would you recommend so again I

wouldn't want to because you're your own

person I won't want to tell you what to

do and you don't need to make a decision

today about the test that you want to

have we can give you some information

about about the risk to your baby of VQ

scan and about the risk to you the CT

scan and help you to make the decisions

with this use of the CT p p CT p a scan

John has more that has a various a bit

better at detecting the clots than the

VQ scan so if you have the CT PA

it is slightly a bit more better

detecting a clot if there is one there

then the VQ scan was a VQ scan can very

rarely sometimes miss a clot that's

there but you have to consider that the

CT PA you you might not want that's

because of the small increased risk to

yourself later in life and again with a

VQ scan you might not want that because

of the small increased risk of childhood

cancers with having that which isn't

easy decision to make but we can help

you with that okay any other questions

for me well we talked a lot about today

and as I say if you have any further

questions ask us and Walter wolf

we'll start with the treatment and get

these all these scans organized for you

thank you nice seeing you well I think

right okay so you've seen the patient

you've spoken to her about this

suspected diagnosis of PE would you like

to tell me what principles guided your

discussion your conversation with the

patient please

so my discussion was mainly guided by

the four main principles of core

principles of medical ethics main one

with this that was relevant was autonomy

was the patient's choice and her right

to choose what's investigation she had

and what treatment she had Urich

principle is beneficence and doing the

right thing for your patients and making

sure that everything that we're doing is

really in the best interests for the

patient and the baby as well and also

non-maleficence is another important

principle and that goes about not doing

any harm and that can be tricky

sometimes beneficence and

non-maleficence they can contradict one

another in a situation or example where

this see TPA would be beneficial or VQ

scan would be Venice it beneficial to

the mother in seen if there was a PE but

it could harm the baby in some way so

there is a balance sometimes between

been

in non-maleficence and the final

principle justice is about treating

people equally and which may not be as

relevant in this situation that's

another principle to keep in mind okay

good they'll just come to your first

principle you mentioned autonomy other

than these situations you can think

where you wouldn't give that autonomy to

your patient

so autonomy the only time you wouldn't

is if the patient doesn't have capacity

and if someone you don't believe they

had capacity there's various reasons for

that you as a doctor would have to do

what is in the best interest of the

patient and that may mean involving

relatives or carers or close family

friends or maybe other healthcare

professionals who have known the patient

for a long time to try and see what is

the best thing to do for that patients

okay let me just ask you a couple of

questions on capacity can you think of

the principles of how you would assess

capacity okay so there were four things

that it number one is that you should

always assume that a patient has

capacity only when you feel they don't

have capacity then then you go and

assess so it's you should assume that

every patient you see has capacity there

are four ways in which someone needs to

have to say they do have capacity number

one is that they understand what you're

saying and they accept that as the truth

number two is they can retain that

information they can remember that

information for a reasonable period of

time okay the third one is that they can

weigh that information up to sort it to

make a decision that decision may not be

what you think is appropriate but it's

that they can weigh that information or

to make a balanced decision and the

fourth thing is that they communicate

that decision in some way and if they

have all those four then a patient has a

capacity okay can you think of any

examples where a patient might lack

capacity and so one example is a patient

who may have cognitive impairment such

as an Alzheimer's dementia okay because

of the Alzheimer's dementia their

short-term memory may sorts of memory

may be impaired yeah sorry they may not

be able to reach

the information you're giving them for a

long enough period of time to weigh that

information on okay so that's one

example where someone may in what

capacity can you think of an example

where they may have a lack of an ability

to communicate so patients who have

strokes sometimes if their speech is

affected or their writing is affected

and sometimes it may be difficult to

communicate in that situation you as a

healthcare professional should do

everything you can to enhance and how

they can communicate so there are visual

aids where people can point to films or

sometimes we've locked-in syndrome

people blink yeah I too community yes

yeah good good okay let me just move on

from your principles of assessment of

capacity on to the treatment and the

investigations that you are offering to

the patient you mentioned about the risk

of breast cancer to the mother how much

did you say was the increased risk so I

believe from the literature the

increased risk for Brad can't resist by

not 0.7 percent so 7 ounce 4,000 is that

the increased risk yes okay okay good

and you said you're going to treat for

the entire duration of a pregnancy which

is going to be like seven seven and a

half months from now positive seven

months and also for six weeks after yes

yeah okay so for example you sorry you

decided not to give a war friend hmm

can you think of a reason why we don't

use water because water is teratogenic

they passed the placenta can give it to

a wall Alexandra

this generation who they do have a lot

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,179

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,580
how would you describe yourself and it

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,379
those three pieces being biracial being

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,410
a woman and age-wise those are pieces of

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,660
just locating your spell's yourself in

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,100
space and time at this point in time

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,430
how long have you thought of yourself as

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,590
a biracial woman well my racial to be

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,810
honest miss McCraw at third grade I knew

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,580
that I was different I would say that

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,299
how'd you know that

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,299
oh well my Barrett came to pick up my

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,869
report card from school mm-hmm and

25
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,400
everyone was looking and you know

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,380
pointing and everything it wasn't a

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,110
problem for the students it was a

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,740
problem for the faculty and the teachers

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,299
were you treated differently after that

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,350
yes okay it would be give me just to

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,240
stop and ask you what what is your

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,200
ethnic and racial background nobody said

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,899
how my mother's african-american okay so

34
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,360
after that encounter Nets third-grader

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,630
dad goes he's Latino mm-hmm goes to pick

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,399
up your report card and to pick up you

37
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,189
up how are you treated differently after

38
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,600
that well the next day I went to school

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,570
add a note and like the most a blue

40
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,180
t-shirt so when I got home of course my

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,680
mother with the mo they went to

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,068
parent-teacher conference

43
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,090
and we got there I was actually the room

44
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,030
and what I got the gist of it I told my

45
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,719
parents how me being a mixed waste or

46
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,730
about having two different parents at

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,159
the time could be a bad thing for me

48
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,780
yeah because I went to a predominantly

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,720
african-american but heesu will be

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,549
something sort of like you know apples

51
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:36,310
and oranges don't mix you know you're

52
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,760
not brought by kiss you might camera and

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,379
you know you had to address the picture

54
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,230
who he wants to be I pick Harriet Tubman

55
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,989
mm-hmm no and it was like oh you're not

56
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,599
black enough to be her and that pictures

57
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,359
on the wall and look at her she's black

58
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:53,799
you know what he wouldn't put black pen

59
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,359
on her face and you don't know what it's

60
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,310
like to be a slave and things like that

61
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,870
so it became up

62
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,579
it wasn't hurt and it was I didn't

63
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,769
understand right are you sure none of it

64
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,799
hurt at that point I won't think of it I

65
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,569
just didn't ever say a word pity party

66
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,359
no other time sort of just sort of get

67
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,129
to over the years because there's an age

68
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,500
where the kids get sort of meaner about

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,840
the teasing and aren't really even high

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,669
school thinking mmm

71
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,739
high school the same thing came up just

72
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,639
put in a secret email and

73
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,269
african-american students are probably

74
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,459
there so the Latino students had a bob

75
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,629
with it's they're not caught in the

76
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:28,930
middle

77
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,510
this is under do you do do you think

78
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,239
she's grouted yes I do

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,479
I think she's emotionally guarded and I

80
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,790
think she'll speak to that later in the

81
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,280
session you know so it says I think

82
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,480
there have been injuries

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,830
some of which I'm gonna guess really are

84
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,230
related to the the race pieces that

85
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,530
she's experienced where she has felt

86
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,720
judged under scrutiny and it just keeps

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,390
repeating herself and it's separate from

88
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,510
comportment accomplishments and say

89
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,890
there is a guardedness and there is a

90
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,019
sensitivity and the guardedness is her

91
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,940
way I think of protecting some of her

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,440
so why don't we take a look at this

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719
thought i'll never fit in and spend some

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,519
time

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,280
looking at the evidence that supports it

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
and the evidence that wouldn't support

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,480
it now

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,880
and and over your lifetime and and when

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,400
i'm thinking about evidence i'm thinking

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,880
about

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,599
actually actual things things that you

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,880
could bring up in court as

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,720
actual evidence not just i feel that

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
that's the way it is

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
but actual events or circumstances or

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
people that have been a part of your

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,960
life that would be evidence one way or

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,600
the other

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,160
okay so if we're looking at evidence for

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,040
this particular thought

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,840
right now what do you have that would

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
lead you to

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
think i'll never fit in i just am so

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,559
different

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,079
from everybody i just everyone is so

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,920
you know just different from how i have

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
always been they go to happy hours and

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
they drink a lot it's

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,760
just never been me so you're different

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
from the people at work

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
right um

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
and some of that is because they do some

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
drinking and that's not what you've been

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,520
accustomed to

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
they drink a lot and you know they dress

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
a lot different than i do everyone's

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
more into how they look and things like

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,400
that but i've never been how i

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,159
am uh-huh so appearance is really

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,920
important and

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,119
people get pretty dressed up where you

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
work yeah people are always dressing up

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,680
for work

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
okay and

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
what else in terms of evidence for i'm

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
not going to fit in

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
i guess the fact that it's been three

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
months two months

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
since i've been here and nothing's

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,240
changing it just seems like it's getting

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,159
worse

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
so in the three months you've been in

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,360
philadelphia

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,000
you haven't made much headway in making

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
relationships

55
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,240
right

56
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
and you certainly felt worse but it's

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
also true that you've gotten depressed

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
right and

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,560
if we were looking at evidence against

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,318
is there any relationship that you've

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,640
been able to

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
make i mean there is somebody at work

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
that works in the office next to me that

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,319
we've worked together on a couple

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
projects okay

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
and and what's that person saying

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
jack okay so you and jack have worked

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,360
together on some

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
projects and how have you gotten along

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,440
i mean at work we get along pretty well

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
we work well together

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,200
um we're about the same age and he's

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720
been in the company for about two years

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
okay so and he's pretty knowledgeable

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,319
about what how things work at the the

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,920
office and

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
we've the we've gotten some pretty good

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
reviews from the boss on

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
how the work that we've done together so

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
not only have you felt like

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
you've been in sync at work with him but

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
other people have noticed that you work

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,879
well together you've gotten some good

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,599
reviews

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
yeah and and what about sort of

86
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
interpersonally has that worked out

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
i mean we're about the same age and so i

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,959
mean we do have some things in common

89
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
um but i mean he's outside of work i

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,959
mean he's his family he's married and

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,480
has a child

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
so okay so he has some differences but

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
but still you've had a lot of

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,319
conversations about work things that you

95
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
felt good about good okay

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
anybody else i mean there's some people

97
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,480
here and there like

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
in my apartment complex that live around

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
me that you know i've casually said hi

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
to here and there

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
nothing substantial i would say okay

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,680
what about before before you came to

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
philly

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
well before i came to philly life was

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,159
just so much different i mean i

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
i ran for cross country and so i had

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
some friends in cross country and

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,360
i sang in the choir so you know i had

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,519
that group of people

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
and were you doing either of those

111
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,560
things

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,200
after school after college i sing in the

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
choir continue to do that with the

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
community so all the way up to when you

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,439
moved here right

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
and had connections there friends that

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
you did things with right

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
okay and still rain with some of my

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
friends that you know we continue to you

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,799
know run

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,000
every once in a while right okay

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,199
and any other relationships friends that

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,238
you've kept

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,918
kept in touch with since you've moved

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,358
sure i still keep in touch with some of

126
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,639
my friends from

127
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,240
choir and cross country from time to

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
time have any of them moved away

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
a couple couple have and living in other

130
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,440
cities

131
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
right and still despite that distance

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
you've kind of stayed in touch

133
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,199
sporadically yeah i mean not as like not

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
like it was back when we were on the

135
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
same city but i mean from time to time

136
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
we catch up how are they doing they all

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
seem to be doing pretty well

138
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
i mean judged on the things that they

139
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
post online and the text message they

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
seem to be pretty happy they have nice

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
apartments and

142
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,759
they all seem like their lives are all

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,280
put together pretty well when did they

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
move

145
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
roughly about the same time i did at the

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
same time yeah but they're looking

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
like they've established things a little

148
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
more than you felt like you had

149
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,440
they post pictures of you know with

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
their new friends whether they're making

151
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
friends or networking

152
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,199
or going out with like their new

153
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
co-workers and things like that and

154
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
you've been doing some comparing it

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
sounds like

156
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
yeah okay all right so if we were to

157
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,320
look at all of this

158
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
together we have they hear this

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,080
statement i

160
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
i'll never fit in and we've got evidence

161
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,240
on this side saying

162
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
i feel different from other people at

163
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
work they do different things than i

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
like to do they dress a little

165
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
differently

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
i've been three months here and i've not

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
made much headway of

168
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
making relationships and and the

169
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
evidence on this side

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
i've gotten along well with the guy next

171
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,039
door to me at work and

172
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,360
and we've done projects together we've

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
done gotten good reviews

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
i say hi to a couple people at the

175
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
apartment but in my life i've

176
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
had a lot of connections back in my

177
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,199
hometown i ran with friends after

178
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,080
college

179
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,800
i stayed in the community choir i sang

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
through college

181
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,880
in high school and i still stay in touch

182
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
with friends that i've had

183
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
really pretty much through your lifetime

184
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
back in your hometown

185
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
how does that size up in terms of

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
changing

187
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
this belief how much do you believe i'll

188
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,680
never

189
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,840
fit in when you look at all of this

190
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
evidence

191
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
well looking at it like this i i mean i

192
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
guess it seems like

193
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
it's not as as as intense as it was

194
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,080
before

195
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,319
uh-huh so on a scale of zero to a

196
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,160
hundred i'd say probably about like a

197
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,720
seventy

198
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,360
like a 70. so it's so it's come down a

199
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,039
little bit

200
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
but it sounds like there's still some

201
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
sticking points here

202
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
sure and it seems to me like there are

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
two parts to those sticking points

204
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,440
and one part is that we have to really

205
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,000
sort of

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
keep at looking at evidence for and

207
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,319
against your thinking but the other part

208
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,120
is it

209
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,919
it seems to me that some of the issue

210
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,199
here is that

211
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,479
you just haven't had much experience

212
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,599
with moving away

213
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,000
and beginning to establish a life for

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,039
yourself

215
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,560
that's right this is this is my first

216
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
time moving away from home

217
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
and and that one of the things that's

218
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,800
pretty normal

219
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,120
in that circumstance is that people feel

220
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
pretty lonely

221
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
that that being lonely is actually

222
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,880
something we

223
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
think about now as as being something

224
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
that happens to people biologically

225
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,080
that it sets off kind of alarm bells for

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,039
us to

227
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,479
to be able to find relationships and

228
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,560
it's actually pretty painful experience

229
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
and you certainly know that

230
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
and so one of the things that we have to

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
do as you're feeling better

232
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
is maybe even thinking of some ways to

233
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,560
fortify

234
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
you so that you can reach out and

235
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
maybe connect up with people doing some

236
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,680
of those activities that were so

237
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
important to you

238
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,520
it also sounds like it might be

239
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,319
reasonable

240
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
for you to find out if some of your

241
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,639
other friends

242
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
had such an easy time of it along the

243
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,720
way or what they did

244
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
in terms of forming other relationships

245
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,639
when they moved away

246
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,240
because i think it's a really common

247
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,000
experience it's been

248
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
certainly in the people i've talked to

249
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
over the years it's it's a common thing

250
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,479
to

251
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,440
take a little while to feel like you're

252
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
starting to establish a life for

253
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
yourself in another place

254
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,360
but this depression has really kept you

255
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,840
from reaching out it seems like and

256
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
yeah absolutely and i kind of i don't

257
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,039
want to put myself out there because i

258
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
don't want to let them know that i'm not

259
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,000
doing so well yeah

260
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
that's kind of you know made me feel

261
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
like i couldn't reach out to them

262
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
yeah i think those walls that you're

263
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
putting up might might be getting in the

264
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,959
way too absolutely

265
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,480
we should talk about ways of getting

266
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
around that

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
so in this next week one thing that i

268
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
was hoping that we would do

269
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
would be to start to collect some more

270
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,360
of the thoughts that are

271
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,080
so extreme like i'll never fit in okay

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,959
and

273
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
so i'm going to give you this thought

274
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,560
record to do that the same one that we

275
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
used earlier

276
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
and here's the three columns that i'm

277
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
going to want you to fill out

278
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,959
the first column it says situation the

279
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
second emotion and the third automatic

280
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,760
thoughts

281
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
but the emotion is what i want you to

282
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,279
use

283
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
to be the signal that it's time to look

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,519
at what you're thinking

285
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
because emotions are really there to get

286
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
our attention that's their job

287
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
and so when you find yourself feeling a

288
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,240
mood shift

289
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,040
either feeling pretty low or pretty

290
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
upset about something

291
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,279
i want you to ask yourself what just was

292
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,959
i thinking what was going through my

293
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,600
mind

294
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
and just note what you were feeling what

295
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,120
you were thinking and

296
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,839
what the situation was right before then

297
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,360
you think that's a possibility

298
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
sure and it doesn't have to be the great

299
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,480
american novel you can

300
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
you know just take a few notes and

301
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
sometimes even people like doing it in

302
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
their phone because they can have that

303
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,399
right with them and

304
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,760
don't have to carry around a piece of

305
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,839
paper at work and feel self-conscious

306
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
about that

307
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,320
the other important thing about this is

308
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,959
that

309
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
there's this whole other half which is

310
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
generating some different ways of

311
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
thinking about things that we're just

312
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,240
learning how to do

313
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,160
this examining the evidence is one way

314
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
to start doing that

315
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
and you might not

316
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
know how to do this part yet because we

317
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,880
haven't gone over it very

318
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,040
much in the session so when you're

319
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,120
collecting all of these thoughts

320
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
it could be the case that you start

321
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
feeling sadder

322
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,519
because you're just seeing how you're

323
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,399
thinking and if that happens i want you

324
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,680
to stop

325
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,440
because you and i are going to finish

326
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
the job next week and give

327
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
get you a a handle on how to begin to

328
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
examine some of these things

329
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
the other thing i'm going to give you is

330
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
this list and this list is

331
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,440
actually the kinds of common ways

332
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,680
that everybody you me all humans

333
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,920
really think about things that get them

334
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,040
into trouble

335
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,760
and we have a mind that is not so

336
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
scientific when it comes to thinking

337
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
about ourselves or thinking about other

338
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,000
people

339
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
if you take a look at those you might

340
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,279
see that there's one or

341
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,079
two that is a common way that you think

342
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,600
about things

343
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
which one over-generalizing and that

344
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
is a negative event is seen as a

345
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
never-ending pattern of defeat

346
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
right like staying home on friday night

347
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
and thinking

348
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
i'm i'm never going to make a life for

349
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
myself here

350
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
and so when you start to have those

351
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,959
particular extreme thoughts

352
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,399
of course that's going to make it more

353
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
likely that you feel worse and

354
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
and most of us when we have that

355
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
circumstance

356
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
tend to do things like do even less

357
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
that really make the situation even more

358
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,200
difficult for us

359
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
and so we want to get out of that

360
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
endless loop

361
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
so does that seem like a plan for the

362
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,680
week sure absolutely

363
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
okay great i think this will give us a

364
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
handle on things a little bit more and

365
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
we'll get to how to change these

366
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
thoughts when you come back in next week

367
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:11,600
sounds good

368
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
you
","so why don't we take a look at this

thought i'll never fit in and spend some

time

looking at the evidence that supports it

and the evidence that wouldn't support

it now

and and over your lifetime and and when

i'm thinking about evidence i'm thinking

about

actually actual things things that you

could bring up in court as

actual evidence not just i feel that

that's the way it is

but actual events or circumstances or

people that have been a part of your

life that would be evidence one way or

the other

okay so if we're looking at evidence for

this particular thought

right now what do you have that would

lead you to

think i'll never fit in i just am so

different

from everybody i just everyone is so

you know just different from how i have

always been they go to happy hours and

they drink a lot it's

just never been me so you're different

from the people at work

right um

and some of that is because they do some

drinking and that's not what you've been

accustomed to

they drink a lot and you know they dress

a lot different than i do everyone's

more into how they look and things like

that but i've never been how i

am uh-huh so appearance is really

important and

people get pretty dressed up where you

work yeah people are always dressing up

for work

okay and

what else in terms of evidence for i'm

not going to fit in

i guess the fact that it's been three

months two months

since i've been here and nothing's

changing it just seems like it's getting

worse

so in the three months you've been in

philadelphia

you haven't made much headway in making

relationships

right

and you certainly felt worse but it's

also true that you've gotten depressed

right and

if we were looking at evidence against

is there any relationship that you've

been able to

make i mean there is somebody at work

that works in the office next to me that

we've worked together on a couple

projects okay

and and what's that person saying

jack okay so you and jack have worked

together on some

projects and how have you gotten along

i mean at work we get along pretty well

we work well together

um we're about the same age and he's

been in the company for about two years

okay so and he's pretty knowledgeable

about what how things work at the the

office and

we've the we've gotten some pretty good

reviews from the boss on

how the work that we've done together so

not only have you felt like

you've been in sync at work with him but

other people have noticed that you work

well together you've gotten some good

reviews

yeah and and what about sort of

interpersonally has that worked out

i mean we're about the same age and so i

mean we do have some things in common

um but i mean he's outside of work i

mean he's his family he's married and

has a child

so okay so he has some differences but

but still you've had a lot of

conversations about work things that you

felt good about good okay

anybody else i mean there's some people

here and there like

in my apartment complex that live around

me that you know i've casually said hi

to here and there

nothing substantial i would say okay

what about before before you came to

philly

well before i came to philly life was

just so much different i mean i

i ran for cross country and so i had

some friends in cross country and

i sang in the choir so you know i had

that group of people

and were you doing either of those

things

after school after college i sing in the

choir continue to do that with the

community so all the way up to when you

moved here right

and had connections there friends that

you did things with right

okay and still rain with some of my

friends that you know we continue to you

know run

every once in a while right okay

and any other relationships friends that

you've kept

kept in touch with since you've moved

sure i still keep in touch with some of

my friends from

choir and cross country from time to

time have any of them moved away

a couple couple have and living in other

cities

right and still despite that distance

you've kind of stayed in touch

sporadically yeah i mean not as like not

like it was back when we were on the

same city but i mean from time to time

we catch up how are they doing they all

seem to be doing pretty well

i mean judged on the things that they

post online and the text message they

seem to be pretty happy they have nice

apartments and

they all seem like their lives are all

put together pretty well when did they

move

roughly about the same time i did at the

same time yeah but they're looking

like they've established things a little

more than you felt like you had

they post pictures of you know with

their new friends whether they're making

friends or networking

or going out with like their new

co-workers and things like that and

you've been doing some comparing it

sounds like

yeah okay all right so if we were to

look at all of this

together we have they hear this

statement i

i'll never fit in and we've got evidence

on this side saying

i feel different from other people at

work they do different things than i

like to do they dress a little

differently

i've been three months here and i've not

made much headway of

making relationships and and the

evidence on this side

i've gotten along well with the guy next

door to me at work and

and we've done projects together we've

done gotten good reviews

i say hi to a couple people at the

apartment but in my life i've

had a lot of connections back in my

hometown i ran with friends after

college

i stayed in the community choir i sang

through college

in high school and i still stay in touch

with friends that i've had

really pretty much through your lifetime

back in your hometown

how does that size up in terms of

changing

this belief how much do you believe i'll

never

fit in when you look at all of this

evidence

well looking at it like this i i mean i

guess it seems like

it's not as as as intense as it was

before

uh-huh so on a scale of zero to a

hundred i'd say probably about like a

seventy

like a 70. so it's so it's come down a

little bit

but it sounds like there's still some

sticking points here

sure and it seems to me like there are

two parts to those sticking points

and one part is that we have to really

sort of

keep at looking at evidence for and

against your thinking but the other part

is it

it seems to me that some of the issue

here is that

you just haven't had much experience

with moving away

and beginning to establish a life for

yourself

that's right this is this is my first

time moving away from home

and and that one of the things that's

pretty normal

in that circumstance is that people feel

pretty lonely

that that being lonely is actually

something we

think about now as as being something

that happens to people biologically

that it sets off kind of alarm bells for

us to

to be able to find relationships and

it's actually pretty painful experience

and you certainly know that

and so one of the things that we have to

do as you're feeling better

is maybe even thinking of some ways to

fortify

you so that you can reach out and

maybe connect up with people doing some

of those activities that were so

important to you

it also sounds like it might be

reasonable

for you to find out if some of your

other friends

had such an easy time of it along the

way or what they did

in terms of forming other relationships

when they moved away

because i think it's a really common

experience it's been

certainly in the people i've talked to

over the years it's it's a common thing

to

take a little while to feel like you're

starting to establish a life for

yourself in another place

but this depression has really kept you

from reaching out it seems like and

yeah absolutely and i kind of i don't

want to put myself out there because i

don't want to let them know that i'm not

doing so well yeah

that's kind of you know made me feel

like i couldn't reach out to them

yeah i think those walls that you're

putting up might might be getting in the

way too absolutely

we should talk about ways of getting

around that

so in this next week one thing that i

was hoping that we would do

would be to start to collect some more

of the thoughts that are

so extreme like i'll never fit in okay

and

so i'm going to give you this thought

record to do that the same one that we

used earlier

and here's the three columns that i'm

going to want you to fill out

the first column it says situation the

second emotion and the third automatic

thoughts

but the emotion is what i want you to

use

to be the signal that it's time to look

at what you're thinking

because emotions are really there to get

our attention that's their job

and so when you find yourself feeling a

mood shift

either feeling pretty low or pretty

upset about something

i want you to ask yourself what just was

i thinking what was going through my

mind

and just note what you were feeling what

you were thinking and

what the situation was right before then

you think that's a possibility

sure and it doesn't have to be the great

american novel you can

you know just take a few notes and

sometimes even people like doing it in

their phone because they can have that

right with them and

don't have to carry around a piece of

paper at work and feel self-conscious

about that

the other important thing about this is

that

there's this whole other half which is

generating some different ways of

thinking about things that we're just

learning how to do

this examining the evidence is one way

to start doing that

and you might not

know how to do this part yet because we

haven't gone over it very

much in the session so when you're

collecting all of these thoughts

it could be the case that you start

feeling sadder

because you're just seeing how you're

thinking and if that happens i want you

to stop

because you and i are going to finish

the job next week and give

get you a a handle on how to begin to

examine some of these things

the other thing i'm going to give you is

this list and this list is

actually the kinds of common ways

that everybody you me all humans

really think about things that get them

into trouble

and we have a mind that is not so

scientific when it comes to thinking

about ourselves or thinking about other

people

if you take a look at those you might

see that there's one or

two that is a common way that you think

about things

which one over-generalizing and that

is a negative event is seen as a

never-ending pattern of defeat

right like staying home on friday night

and thinking

i'm i'm never going to make a life for

myself here

and so when you start to have those

particular extreme thoughts

of course that's going to make it more

likely that you feel worse and

and most of us when we have that

circumstance

tend to do things like do even less

that really make the situation even more

difficult for us

and so we want to get out of that

endless loop

so does that seem like a plan for the

week sure absolutely

okay great i think this will give us a

handle on things a little bit more and

we'll get to how to change these

thoughts when you come back in next week

sounds good

you

very much okay okay have you finished so

80
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,870
to complete my examination I'd like to

81
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,400
perform a shifting dullness test check

82
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,039
his urine dip and also I'd like to

83
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,620
examine for a full limp retinopathy

84
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,960
screen including the axillary and

85
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,620
inguinal lymph nodes and I'd also like

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,949
to check his observations okay would you

87
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,860
like to present your case now please

88
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,599
so at examined the 21 year old

89
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,629
University student was coming with

90
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,669
abdominal pain the only positive

91
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,699
findings on my examination were jaundice

92
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,789
and a two-finger with hepatomegaly there

93
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,819
was no obvious ergonomically or no other

94
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,129
signs of chronic liver disease there was

95
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,310
no other scars or cirrhosis okay that's

96
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,349
good so tell me you mentioned about

97
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,960
jaundice are you sure the patient was

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,680
jaundiced so he had a very faint hint of

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,599
jaundice it wasn't ovoid clear jaundiced

100
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,210
okay and you mentioned about a

101
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,240
two-finger breath hepatomegaly was the

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,779
patient tender in his abdomen so he had

103
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,259
tender hepatomegaly on palpation okay

104
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,349
would you like to think of a few causes

105
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,629
of a tender hepatomegaly in a young

106
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,979
patient like luke so top of my

107
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,500
differentials would be hepatitis which

108
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,810
could have a infective alcoholic

109
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,029
hepatitis okay the other things I would

110
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,009
like to rule out would be any kind of

111
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,729
malignancies

112
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,310
any infiltrative disorders but Kyary

113
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,060
syndrome okay

114
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,740
congestive cardiac failure well done

115
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,110
lately in this case for his age and I'd

116
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,139
like to do some blood tests and further

117
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,270
investigations to look further into the

118
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,810
problem

119
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,150
okay well let's let's just look at this

120
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,490
particular case what do you think would

121
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,639
be the top of your list as a cause of

122
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,550
the tender hepatomegaly in this 21 year

123
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,990
old student so I would be considering

124
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,680
hepatitis as a top differential probably

125
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,740
viral hepatitis or rather than a leak

126
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,229
apparatus okay what if I add in a little

127
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,680
piece of history about Luke he has

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,440
returned two weeks ago after a holiday

129
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,010
to the Central African Republic what

130
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,050
would you like to think about so I'd

131
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,360
like to start thinking about hepatitis A

132
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,310
hepatitis B hepatitis C and hepatitis E

133
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,660
although hepatitis B would be a bit

134
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,299
unlikely taking it to history is

135
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,880
two-week history of return okay okay

136
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,339
well let's how would you have you come

137
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,920
across any blood tests that would either

138
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,720
confirm or rule out viral hepatitis

139
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
so for we'd like to do some set logical

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,589
tests for hepatitis for hepatitis A I'd

141
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,990
like to check his ID hepatitis A

142
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,300
antibodies IgM antibodies for hepatitis

143
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,390
B I would like to check his hepatitis B

144
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,480
surface antigen okay hepatitis B core

145
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,640
antibody okay and hepatitis B antigen

146
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,670
right which is the antigen that goes up

147
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,510
first in hepatitis B so that would be

148
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,600
hepatitis B surface antigen and

149
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,000
hepatitis B or LD body okay okay let's

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,650
just come to hepatitis A what what type

151
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,260
of antibodies are you expecting to rise

152
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,800
initially so within the first four week

153
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,020
period I'd expect a rise in the IgM

154
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,720
variety of the hepatitis A activity okay

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,700
afterwards I'd expect that

156
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,270
hi Gigi okay right okay that's good okay

157
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,380

to know them sofa nice if I couldn't fit

scenery and inguinal lymph nodes okay we

can do that later

hey can i I'm gonna pull down on your

eyelids okay just looking for any

evidence of anemia looking up look down

for me there's a faint tint of yellow

pigment in the sclera right okay

would you like to just lie down flat for

good look for any scars sinuses any

feel on your tummy now okay so I'll try

to get down to the level of the patient

very much okay okay have you finished so

to complete my examination I'd like to

perform a shifting dullness test check

his urine dip and also I'd like to

examine for a full limp retinopathy

screen including the axillary and

inguinal lymph nodes and I'd also like

to check his observations okay would you

like to present your case now please

so at examined the 21 year old

University student was coming with

abdominal pain the only positive

findings on my examination were jaundice

and a two-finger with hepatomegaly there

was no obvious ergonomically or no other

signs of chronic liver disease there was

no other scars or cirrhosis okay that's

good so tell me you mentioned about

jaundice are you sure the patient was

jaundiced so he had a very faint hint of

jaundice it wasn't ovoid clear jaundiced

okay and you mentioned about a

two-finger breath hepatomegaly was the

patient tender in his abdomen so he had

tender hepatomegaly on palpation okay

would you like to think of a few causes

of a tender hepatomegaly in a young

patient like luke so top of my

differentials would be hepatitis which

could have a infective alcoholic

hepatitis okay the other things I would

like to rule out would be any kind of

malignancies

any infiltrative disorders but Kyary

syndrome okay

congestive cardiac failure well done

lately in this case for his age and I'd

like to do some blood tests and further

investigations to look further into the

problem

okay well let's let's just look at this

particular case what do you think would

be the top of your list as a cause of

the tender hepatomegaly in this 21 year

old student so I would be considering

hepatitis as a top differential probably

viral hepatitis or rather than a leak

apparatus okay what if I add in a little

piece of history about Luke he has

returned two weeks ago after a holiday

to the Central African Republic what

would you like to think about so I'd

like to start thinking about hepatitis A

hepatitis B hepatitis C and hepatitis E

although hepatitis B would be a bit

unlikely taking it to history is

two-week history of return okay okay

well let's how would you have you come

across any blood tests that would either

confirm or rule out viral hepatitis

so for we'd like to do some set logical

tests for hepatitis for hepatitis A I'd

like to check his ID hepatitis A

antibodies IgM antibodies for hepatitis

B I would like to check his hepatitis B

surface antigen okay hepatitis B core

antibody okay and hepatitis B antigen

right which is the antigen that goes up

first in hepatitis B so that would be

hepatitis B surface antigen and

hepatitis B or LD body okay okay let's

just come to hepatitis A what what type

of antibodies are you expecting to rise

initially so within the first four week

period I'd expect a rise in the IgM

variety of the hepatitis A activity okay

afterwards I'd expect that

hi Gigi okay right okay that's good okay

thank you

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
a little Joey I'm glad to have you back

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,160
today how you doing pretty good deal now

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,680
I did some homework on that I designed

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,730
with you I did yeah okay well before we

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,500
go through that list did you have any

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,089
moment this week where you had to do any

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,580
public speaking

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,380
yes I was assigned to train the other

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,199
officers that I work with

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,340
on an a field app that we created I did

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,710
it with another

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,930
coworker and we were supposed to train

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,989
everybody else I say okay so was it

14
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,790
distressing or did you have better luck

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,000
this time pal man oh no it was it was

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,539
very distressing

17
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,910
with my I

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,640
just get so nervous I get so nervous

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,039
before I have to stand up in front of

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
people yeah for some reason if it's in a

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,760
room of strangers like an interview

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,710
I'm so much better but when it's with

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,750
people that I'm

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,430
that I work with daily or I interact

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,720
with daily I don't know I just get I

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,280
just have so much anxiety about it yeah

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,340
I understand okay so you had to do this

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,130
and so it obviously if you were to read

29
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,590
that from 1 to 10 how distressing was

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,610
this event when you had to do it last

31
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,320
tenant really I mean just just a bunch

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,329
okay all right so through the exercise

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,100
that I had to do at home did you have a

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,990
right mental list of things that you do

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,259
in the moment that you try to do that

36
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,470
alleviates the problem yes I did if I

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,110
wrote a few things down okay

38
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,659
you know it's that classic one that they

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,299
tell you ever

40
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,049
from the time you have to get up and for

41
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,790
whatever you have to do that if you

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,710
stand up in front of a group of people

43
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,299
you're supposed to imagine that they're

44
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,399
all in their underwear and so I did that

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,250
okay good work okay it didn't work all

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,549
right what else did you enlist

47
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,350
you know I I knew what I was going to

48
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,780
have to present

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,990
and you know four days beforehand I

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,240
would go over it in my head and

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,580
stand in front of a mirror and just you

52
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,480
know say the script

53
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,850
thinking that if I you know the more I

54
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,040
prepared that that I wouldn't forget

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,600
but then I get so anxious that when it's

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,070
time for me to actually say something

57
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,060
all of a sudden my mind goes blank

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,880
so it actually cost you more anxiety to

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,080
try to do that yes okay did you have

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,200
anything else on the list I tried deep

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,989
breathing you know before right before I

62
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:52,670
know then I'm gonna have to say

63
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,980
something I

64
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,170
try to take really deep breaths and let

65
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,530
them out slowly and you know to try to

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,500
slow my heart rate down

67
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,870
and it works maybe for a split second

68
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,200
but then I immediately will start to you

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,959
know obsess over it and the fear just

70
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,000
comes right back down so it causes you

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,190
can obsess over even more whenever you

72
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,049
try to do these things that actually you

73
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,970
try when you try to diffuse the moment

74
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,610
alleviate the anxiety you just it gets

75
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,269
worse is that correct yes it does and

76
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,560
you know I guess the last thing I wrote

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,140
down was that you know I just up until

78
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,299
the moment I just I try to think about

79
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,380
other things

80
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,790
so through this exercise the reason why

81
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,079
I had asked you to write down some

82
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,900
things was simply because you've already

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,970
stated within yourself that it obviously

84
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,850
did not alleviate any of the problems it

85
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,440
didn't alleviate your anxiety it didn't

86
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,860
alleviate the stress and

87
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,670
affiliates in the emotions that it

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,890
causes when you try to do when you try

89
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,090
to get in front of people when you try

90
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,769
to speak it doesn't help right and so

91
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,140
with having with me asking you to do

92
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,390
this exercise I think it really shows

93
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,840
that those kind of self-help steps don't

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,970
really work in alleviating the problem

95
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,399
so because of that I ask you to do that

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,750
and so one thing I'll ask you just

97
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,168
simply to do today while you're here

98
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,459
because of that is I want you to rip

99
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,430
that piece of paper out because it does

100
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,620
a help so we're no longer going to do

101
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,060
the list because it is a help

102
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,330
[Music]

103
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,439
and we're going to do that simply

104
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,169
because I think there's a new role a new

105
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,210
identity that joy is going to have in us

106
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,060
with accepting the fear that you have

107
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,889
and I think through counselling and

108
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,389
through different things that we're

109
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,370
going to do throughout time will help

110
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,370
you to be able to have more of a better

111
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,979
idea of self-confidence without with

112
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,810
being able to accept the fact that you

113
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,669
do have anxiety folks you'd be speaking

114
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,800
but you do new well at it and you're

115
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,090
gonna have a better confidence of being

116
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,250
able to adapt to your anxiety in that

117
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,199
and so would you be willing throughout

118
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,580
different sessions with me to be able to

119
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,639
learn how to accept that I've got

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,729
several and obviously that's nothing

121
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,560
I've done it for exactly and that's why

122
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,120
wouldn't you do that just say free to

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,069
say because no self help things that you

124
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,599
can do can actually alleviate your

125
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,610
problem and because of that there's

126
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,740
there's all types of ways that we

127
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,330
there's all types of exercises that we

128
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,509
can do to empower you to you know see

129
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,580
yourself actually being a good speaker

130
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,710
but also accepting the fact that you

131
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,419
have a fear of them and then you may

132
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,069
always have a mirror but it may never go

133
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,229
away and so would you be willing to do

134
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,250
an exercise to have an exercise on

135
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,419
emotions some denied emotions that are

136
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:41,949
just normal responses and normal

137
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,629
emotions that I would like to do with

138
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,449
you today it just will help you have a

139
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,580
better understanding of what's normal in

140
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,740
feeling a certain type of emotion would

141
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,370
you be able to do that today sure okay

142
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,169
okay we're gonna do this exercise today

143
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,430
that will help you kind of get a better

144
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,080
understanding of some real emotions and

145
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,939
you experienced I think it would be very

146
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,939
helpful today so what I'm going to do is

147
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,649
I'm going to run through a list of nine

148
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,289
basic emotions with you and there's a

149
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,020
debate that most experts tend to agree

150
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,729
with in these basics so I'm going to

151
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,289
name some emotion so what you're going

152
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,460
to do is you're going to give me a

153
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,279
thumbs up if it's a good emotion to you

154
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,020
and it thumbs down if it's a negative

155
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,639
emotion to you so see here and love

156
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,270
okay

157
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,270
joy

158
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,230
curiosity

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
anger

160
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,590
fear

161
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,830
sadness

162
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,010
guilt

163
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,340
shock

164
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,970
okay discussed

165
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,590
okay and those were the motions that I

166
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,530
hadn't through that six of the nine

167
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,200
motions you put thumbs down for and

168
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,240
which is very interesting because those

169
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,730
are normal human responses because of

170
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,090
that human responses and emotions so

171
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,610
because of that I think this exercise is

172
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,770
good thing showing is helpful just for

173
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,120
you to just know that those are normal

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,880
human emotions that everyone experiences

175
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,030
every person that you even encounter

176
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,800
with and public speaking has those

177
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,260
responses and even to think I know for

178
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,760
example on the list you gave me earlier

179
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,040
that to think of everyone being exposed

180
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,250
and being naked I know that may not help

181
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,170
alleviate the problem but in a sense if

182
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,910
you can think of everyone experiencing

183
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,460
these emotions of everyone experiencing

184
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,610
Kiryat curiosity anger fear sadness

185
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,570
guilt shame fear is a huge response that

186
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,190
everyone has a different ways and so I

187
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,170
think that could even in a sense help

188
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,540
you kind of accept that you're not the

189
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,210
only one with fear you are a person that

190
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,250
has fear for public speaking but you are

191
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,860
not the only person but you happen to be

192
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,130
one person who experiences fear and so I

193
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,770
think that that exercise just kind of

194
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,570
will show you that those are just normal

195
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,880
responses and it's not just me exactly

196
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,830
it's not just you and they're normal

197
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,470
totally normal from anybody that

198
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,510
experiences any type of motion you were

199
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,020
normal

200
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,620
okay we're going to do a mindfulness

201
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,390
exercise if that's all right I think it

202
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,260
would be helpful for you okay

203
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,159
alright I'm going to read some things

204
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,809
aloud now I'm like you didn't sit up

205
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,700
straight and kind of all the props that

206
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,640
have a book and how I direct you just go

207
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,190
ahead and all the props

208
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,020
so I invite you to sit upright your

209
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,990
chair with your back straight and your

210
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,680
feet flat on the floor

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,600
most people find they feel more alert in

212
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,520
a way it's sitting this way so check it

213
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,930
out and see if this is the case for you

214
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,570
and either close your eyes or fix them

215
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,440
on a spot whichever you prefer

216
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,960
and take a few slow deep breaths and

217
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,850
really notice the breath flowing in and

218
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,330
out of your lungs

219
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,660
now quickly scan your body from head to

220
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,940
toe

221
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,320
starting at your scalp and moving

222
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,570
downward

223
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,360
and notice the sensations you can feel

224
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,230
in your head through

225
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,850
neck shoulders chest

226
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,190
abdomen

227
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,700
arms hands and legs and

228
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,400
now your feet

229
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,810
now zoom in on the part of your body

230
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,270
when you're feeling this feeling most

231
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,090
intensely

232
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,770
and observant feeling closely as if

233
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,660
you're curious scientist who has never

234
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,100
encountered anything like it before

235
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,360
observe the sensation carefully

236
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,740
let your thoughts come and go like

237
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,320
passing cars

238
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,850
and keep your attention on the feeling

239
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,620
notice where it starts and I would have

240
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,550
noticed where it stops

241
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,450
learn as much about it as you can

242
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,310
if you drew an outline around it what

243
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,150
shape would it have

244
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,620
is it on the surface of the body or

245
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,940
inside of you or both

246
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,420
how far inside does it go

247
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,080
where is it the most intense and

248
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,920
where is it the weakest

249
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,430
if you drift off into your thoughts as

250
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,290
soon as you realize it come back and

251
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,350
focus on the sensation

252
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,720
observe it with curiosity how is it

253
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
different in the center than around the

254
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,530
edges

255
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,980
is it light or heavy

256
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,100
moving or still

257
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,839
what is its temperature

258
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,279
are there any hot spots or cold spots

259
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,910
notice the different elements within it

260
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,680
notice that it's not just one sensation

261
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,010
air sensations within sensations notice

262
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,700
the different layers

263
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,130
as you're observing this feeling breathe

264
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,339
into it

265
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,010
imagine your breath flowing into and

266
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,230
around the feeling breathing into and

267
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,649
around it

268
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,230
as you're breathing into it it's as if

269
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,200
in some magical way all this space opens

270
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,350
up inside of you

271
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,149
you'll open up around this feeling and

272
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,110
you make space for it

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,470
expand around it

274
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,790
however you make sense of that reading

275
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,740
into it and opening up around it

276
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,540
see if you can just allow this feeling

277
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,120
to be here

278
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
you don't have to like it or want it

279
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,209
just allow it just let it be

280
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,730
observe it

281
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,579
bring it into it and

282
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,440
open up around it and allow it to be as

283
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,190
it is

284
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,940
you may feel the strong urge to fight

285
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,060
with it or push it away

286
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,040
if so just ignore it urge is there

287
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,640
without acting on it

288
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,290
you continue observing the sensation

289
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,380
don't try to get rid of it or alter it

290
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,769
if it changes by itself that's okay if

291
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:54,670
it doesn't change that's ok too

292
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,990
changing or getting rid of it is not the

293
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,880
goal

294
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,010
your aim is simply to allow it to let it

295
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,160
be

296
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,940
imagine this feeling is an object

297
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,410
as an object what shape does it have is

298
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,449
it a liquid solid or gas is it moving or

299
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,879
still

300
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,000
what color is it

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,410
if you could touch the surface what

302
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,360
would it feel like

303
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,430
wet or dry

304
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,139
rough or smooth hot or cold

305
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,439
soft or hard

306
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,670
serve this object curiously breathe into

307
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,750
it and open up around it

308
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,399
you don't have to like it or one it just

309
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,040
allow it

310
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,329
and notice that you are bigger than the

311
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,300
object no matter how big it is you can

312
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,259
never get bigger than you

313
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,540
this building tells you some valuable

314
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,399
information

315
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,779
tells you that your normal human being

316
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,360
with the human heart

317
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,410
it tells you that you that you are you

318
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,579
but there are things in life that matter

319
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,889
to you

320
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,170
this is what happens when humans feel

321
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,470
this is what happens

322
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,850
this is what humans actually feel when

323
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,189
there's a gap between what we want and

324
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:26,790
what we've got the bigger the gap the

325
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,720
bigger the feeling

326
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,850
I'll take one of your hands and place it

327
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,819
on the apartment take it take one of

328
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:37,680
your hands and place it on this part of

329
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,050
your body

330
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,769
imagine that this is the healing hand

331
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,689
the hand of a loving friend or a parent

332
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:49,439
or nurse and then and feel the warmth

333
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,459
flowing from your hand into your body

334
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,230
now to get rid of fulfilling not to get

335
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,730
rid of the feeling but to make room for

336
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,059
it to soften up and loosen up around it

337
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,389
now hold it gently as if it's a crying

338
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,709
baby or a frightened puppy

339
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:15,040
and letting your hand fall once again

340
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,259
breathe it into the philony and expand

341
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,859
around it

342
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,980
life is like a stage show and on that

343
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,079
stage are all your thoughts and all of

344
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,139
your feelings

345
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,149
and everything that you can see hear

346
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,350
touch taste and smell and for the last

347
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,839
few minutes we dim the lights on the

348
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,419
stage we shine a spotlight on this

349
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:45,059
feeling

350
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,619
now it's time to bring up the rest of

351
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,049
the lights so bring up the lights on

352
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,769
your body notice your arms and legs and

353
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,439
head and neck and notice that you're in

354
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,019
control of your arms and legs regardless

355
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,019
of what you're feeling

356
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,639
just move them around a little to check

357
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,579
out that for yourself and now take a

358
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,259
stretch and how this yourself stretching

359
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,759
and bring up the lights on the room

360
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,069
around you

361
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:16,739
now open your eyes

362
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:18,480
look around

363
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,769
and notice what you can see

364
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,129
and notice what you can hear and notice

365
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,799
that there's not just a feeling here

366
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,869
there's a feeling inside a body inside a

367
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:34,689
room inside a world full of opportunity

368
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,600
and welcome back

369
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,299
so how did that make you feel

370
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,959
Wow

371
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,240
was it relaxing did it enlighten you in

372
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,939
a sense of becoming more in control of

373
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:50,720
your body and your anxiety

374
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,790
it actually

375
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,170
made me feel like that feeling just is

376
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,930
it exists it just is and it's you it is

377
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,490
joy and it's okay it's just another

378
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,770
part of me like

379
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,640
any other part pinky exactly so you did

380
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,789
find a helpful I do good good okay we'll

381
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,589
be back several more more exercise I'd

382
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,809
like to see come back next week if

383
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,880
that's okay sure there's other things

384
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,130
that we could talk about but I think our

385
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,599
time is running short today but we will

386
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,250
I will see you next week if that's all

387
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,569
right yes okay all right
","a little Joey I'm glad to have you back

today how you doing pretty good deal now

I did some homework on that I designed

with you I did yeah okay well before we

go through that list did you have any

moment this week where you had to do any

public speaking

yes I was assigned to train the other

officers that I work with

on an a field app that we created I did

it with another

coworker and we were supposed to train

everybody else I say okay so was it

distressing or did you have better luck

this time pal man oh no it was it was

very distressing

with my I

just get so nervous I get so nervous

before I have to stand up in front of

people yeah for some reason if it's in a

room of strangers like an interview

I'm so much better but when it's with

people that I'm

that I work with daily or I interact

with daily I don't know I just get I

just have so much anxiety about it yeah

I understand okay so you had to do this

and so it obviously if you were to read

that from 1 to 10 how distressing was

this event when you had to do it last

tenant really I mean just just a bunch

okay all right so through the exercise

that I had to do at home did you have a

right mental list of things that you do

in the moment that you try to do that

alleviates the problem yes I did if I

wrote a few things down okay

you know it's that classic one that they

tell you ever

from the time you have to get up and for

whatever you have to do that if you

stand up in front of a group of people

you're supposed to imagine that they're

all in their underwear and so I did that

okay good work okay it didn't work all

right what else did you enlist

you know I I knew what I was going to

have to present

and you know four days beforehand I

would go over it in my head and

stand in front of a mirror and just you

know say the script

thinking that if I you know the more I

prepared that that I wouldn't forget

but then I get so anxious that when it's

time for me to actually say something

all of a sudden my mind goes blank

so it actually cost you more anxiety to

try to do that yes okay did you have

anything else on the list I tried deep

breathing you know before right before I

know then I'm gonna have to say

something I

try to take really deep breaths and let

them out slowly and you know to try to

slow my heart rate down

and it works maybe for a split second

but then I immediately will start to you

know obsess over it and the fear just

comes right back down so it causes you

can obsess over even more whenever you

try to do these things that actually you

try when you try to diffuse the moment

alleviate the anxiety you just it gets

worse is that correct yes it does and

you know I guess the last thing I wrote

down was that you know I just up until

the moment I just I try to think about

other things

so through this exercise the reason why

I had asked you to write down some

things was simply because you've already

stated within yourself that it obviously

did not alleviate any of the problems it

didn't alleviate your anxiety it didn't

alleviate the stress and

affiliates in the emotions that it

causes when you try to do when you try

to get in front of people when you try

to speak it doesn't help right and so

with having with me asking you to do

this exercise I think it really shows

that those kind of self-help steps don't

really work in alleviating the problem

so because of that I ask you to do that

and so one thing I'll ask you just

simply to do today while you're here

because of that is I want you to rip

that piece of paper out because it does

a help so we're no longer going to do

the list because it is a help

[Music]

and we're going to do that simply

because I think there's a new role a new

identity that joy is going to have in us

with accepting the fear that you have

and I think through counselling and

through different things that we're

going to do throughout time will help

you to be able to have more of a better

idea of self-confidence without with

being able to accept the fact that you

do have anxiety folks you'd be speaking

but you do new well at it and you're

gonna have a better confidence of being

able to adapt to your anxiety in that

and so would you be willing throughout

different sessions with me to be able to

learn how to accept that I've got

several and obviously that's nothing

I've done it for exactly and that's why

wouldn't you do that just say free to

say because no self help things that you

can do can actually alleviate your

problem and because of that there's

there's all types of ways that we

there's all types of exercises that we

can do to empower you to you know see

yourself actually being a good speaker

but also accepting the fact that you

have a fear of them and then you may

always have a mirror but it may never go

away and so would you be willing to do

an exercise to have an exercise on

emotions some denied emotions that are

just normal responses and normal

emotions that I would like to do with

you today it just will help you have a

better understanding of what's normal in

feeling a certain type of emotion would

you be able to do that today sure okay

okay we're gonna do this exercise today

that will help you kind of get a better

understanding of some real emotions and

you experienced I think it would be very

helpful today so what I'm going to do is

I'm going to run through a list of nine

basic emotions with you and there's a

debate that most experts tend to agree

with in these basics so I'm going to

name some emotion so what you're going

to do is you're going to give me a

thumbs up if it's a good emotion to you

and it thumbs down if it's a negative

emotion to you so see here and love

okay

joy

curiosity

anger

fear

sadness

guilt

shock

okay discussed

okay and those were the motions that I

hadn't through that six of the nine

motions you put thumbs down for and

which is very interesting because those

are normal human responses because of

that human responses and emotions so

because of that I think this exercise is

good thing showing is helpful just for

you to just know that those are normal

human emotions that everyone experiences

every person that you even encounter

with and public speaking has those

responses and even to think I know for

example on the list you gave me earlier

that to think of everyone being exposed

and being naked I know that may not help

alleviate the problem but in a sense if

you can think of everyone experiencing

these emotions of everyone experiencing

Kiryat curiosity anger fear sadness

guilt shame fear is a huge response that

everyone has a different ways and so I

think that could even in a sense help

you kind of accept that you're not the

only one with fear you are a person that

has fear for public speaking but you are

not the only person but you happen to be

one person who experiences fear and so I

think that that exercise just kind of

will show you that those are just normal

responses and it's not just me exactly

it's not just you and they're normal

totally normal from anybody that

experiences any type of motion you were

normal

okay we're going to do a mindfulness

exercise if that's all right I think it

would be helpful for you okay

alright I'm going to read some things

aloud now I'm like you didn't sit up

straight and kind of all the props that

have a book and how I direct you just go

ahead and all the props

so I invite you to sit upright your

chair with your back straight and your

feet flat on the floor

most people find they feel more alert in

a way it's sitting this way so check it

out and see if this is the case for you

and either close your eyes or fix them

on a spot whichever you prefer

and take a few slow deep breaths and

really notice the breath flowing in and

out of your lungs

now quickly scan your body from head to

toe

starting at your scalp and moving

downward

and notice the sensations you can feel

in your head through

neck shoulders chest

abdomen

arms hands and legs and

now your feet

now zoom in on the part of your body

when you're feeling this feeling most

intensely

and observant feeling closely as if

you're curious scientist who has never

encountered anything like it before

observe the sensation carefully

let your thoughts come and go like

passing cars

and keep your attention on the feeling

notice where it starts and I would have

noticed where it stops

learn as much about it as you can

if you drew an outline around it what

shape would it have

is it on the surface of the body or

inside of you or both

how far inside does it go

where is it the most intense and

where is it the weakest

if you drift off into your thoughts as

soon as you realize it come back and

focus on the sensation

observe it with curiosity how is it

different in the center than around the

edges

is it light or heavy

moving or still

what is its temperature

are there any hot spots or cold spots

notice the different elements within it

notice that it's not just one sensation

air sensations within sensations notice

the different layers

as you're observing this feeling breathe

into it

imagine your breath flowing into and

around the feeling breathing into and

around it

as you're breathing into it it's as if

in some magical way all this space opens

up inside of you

you'll open up around this feeling and

you make space for it

expand around it

however you make sense of that reading

into it and opening up around it

see if you can just allow this feeling

to be here

you don't have to like it or want it

just allow it just let it be

observe it

bring it into it and

open up around it and allow it to be as

it is

you may feel the strong urge to fight

with it or push it away

if so just ignore it urge is there

without acting on it

you continue observing the sensation

don't try to get rid of it or alter it

if it changes by itself that's okay if

it doesn't change that's ok too

changing or getting rid of it is not the

goal

your aim is simply to allow it to let it

be

imagine this feeling is an object

as an object what shape does it have is

it a liquid solid or gas is it moving or

still

what color is it

if you could touch the surface what

would it feel like

wet or dry

rough or smooth hot or cold

soft or hard

serve this object curiously breathe into

it and open up around it

you don't have to like it or one it just

allow it

and notice that you are bigger than the

object no matter how big it is you can

never get bigger than you

this building tells you some valuable

information

tells you that your normal human being

with the human heart

it tells you that you that you are you

but there are things in life that matter

to you

this is what happens when humans feel

this is what happens

this is what humans actually feel when

there's a gap between what we want and

what we've got the bigger the gap the

bigger the feeling

I'll take one of your hands and place it

on the apartment take it take one of

your hands and place it on this part of

your body

imagine that this is the healing hand

the hand of a loving friend or a parent

or nurse and then and feel the warmth

flowing from your hand into your body

now to get rid of fulfilling not to get

rid of the feeling but to make room for

it to soften up and loosen up around it

now hold it gently as if it's a crying

baby or a frightened puppy

and letting your hand fall once again

breathe it into the philony and expand

around it

life is like a stage show and on that

stage are all your thoughts and all of

your feelings

and everything that you can see hear

touch taste and smell and for the last

few minutes we dim the lights on the

stage we shine a spotlight on this

feeling

now it's time to bring up the rest of

the lights so bring up the lights on

your body notice your arms and legs and

head and neck and notice that you're in

control of your arms and legs regardless

of what you're feeling

just move them around a little to check

out that for yourself and now take a

stretch and how this yourself stretching

and bring up the lights on the room

around you

now open your eyes

look around

and notice what you can see

and notice what you can hear and notice

that there's not just a feeling here

there's a feeling inside a body inside a

room inside a world full of opportunity

and welcome back

so how did that make you feel

Wow

was it relaxing did it enlighten you in

a sense of becoming more in control of

your body and your anxiety

it actually

made me feel like that feeling just is

it exists it just is and it's you it is

joy and it's okay it's just another

part of me like

any other part pinky exactly so you did

find a helpful I do good good okay we'll

be back several more more exercise I'd

like to see come back next week if

that's okay sure there's other things

that we could talk about but I think our

time is running short today but we will

people been in and out so they're a bit

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,210
on edge and bit confuse okay okay well

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,039
that's that's why I've come to talk to

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,289
you tell me what you understand so far

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,470
what people said to you basically after

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,840
my wife gave birth a few hours ago they

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,670
told to me was healthy but they couldn't

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,439
decide decide whether there was a girl

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,770
or boy and they normally said anything

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,260
and just whispering it okay okay you're

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,899
just confused okay well what you say is

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,160
absolutely right and I'm sorry that you

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,840
feel confused but sometimes at the

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,090
beginning things aren't clear we need a

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,640
bit of time to sort things out so that's

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,370
what we intend to do over the next few

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,550
hours and days so I've actually been to

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,610
see your baby myself as you say lots of

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,890
people whisking in and out and sometimes

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,140
when babies are born you can't be

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,180
certain what sex the baby is and it's

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,709
really important not to say one thing

28
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,390
and then be wrong okay in lots of cases

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,250
what you see is you know when you're

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,020
looking at baby's nappy you see

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,369
something which you're not sure is

32
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,340
either kind of very swollen vagina very

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,770
swollen clitoris or a very small penis

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,820
and that's the case with your baby okay

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,350
so it may be that in 24 hours the

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,329
swelling is subsides and it's very clear

37
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,159
that the baby is one sex or another but

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,270
for now we can't be sure what so you're

39
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,869
saying there's something wrong with our

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,420
baby I'm not saying that I'm not saying

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,009
there's something wrong I'm saying there

42
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,930
is potentially a cause for making a fact

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,630
that your baby's genitalia don't look

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,329
normal okay so what we need to do is we

45
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,240
need to do various tests in order to get

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,909
to the bottom of it okay so the first

47
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,159
thing I want to say is it may be that

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,320
every single test

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,139
do is normal and tomorrow when we look

50
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,210
at the baby we can say oh this is

51
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,040
clearly you know this is looking much

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,900
more like a boy or much more like a girl

53
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,850
and we store that this test to reassure

54
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,890
us perfectly it might be that there's

55
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,460
nothing wrong at all okay the test that

56
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,100
we do is we'll do some tests looking at

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,160
the baby's genes so to see whether the

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,160
genes are the genes of a baby girl or a

59
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,280
baby boy that's one of the tests that

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,250
will do and then we'll also do some

61
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,300
other blood tests looking at some other

62
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,500
salt levels in the blood because they

63
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,060
can sometimes be abnormal okay you say

64
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,450
gene gene to us does that mean it's our

65
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,930
fault it's a very good question and no

66
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,810
it definitely isn't your fault okay the

67
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,000
the the commonest cause for us seeing

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,610
this although is very uncommon the

69
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,270
Communist cause is a hormone problem

70
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,620
which we can pick up on the blood test

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,670
okay so that's why you want to do a

72
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,680
blood test it's something can manage or

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
is it something in life wrong I mean III

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,330
can understand you've got lots of

75
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,190
questions and it's a time of great

76
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,540
uncertainty and what we can do is we

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,160
don't know and I don't want to start

78
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,440
talking in great detail about the

79
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,269
different possibilities until we know

80
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,180
what it is so what we're going to do is

81
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,459
we're going to do two tests in the

82
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,799
immediate term and that's to see whether

83
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,080
the baby is on the phone as owners of a

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,970
boy your chromosomes of a girl that's

85
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,739
the genes of a boy or the genes of a

86
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,019
girl okay so we know what their genetic

87
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,420
makeup is yeah and we'll do this other

88
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,340
test looking for this hormone problem

89
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,080
and they will give us a lot of

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,420
information in the first instance and

91
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,570
then we will take it from there thinking

92
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,640
about you know what if anything we need

93
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,360
to do so as I say it may be that your

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,570
baby's totally normal okay if they have

95
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,160
one of these hormone problems

96
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,870
that's something that we can treat very

97
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,320
easily so so what were you going to do

98
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,300
now because you know our relatives keep

99
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,798
coming in and they're like what's what's

100
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,019
his name so I think the best way to

101
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,990
approach it is to just say sometimes

102
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,230
it's not clear and it may become clear

103
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,940
and they're just going to do some tests

104
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,340
and the tests going to hurt the baby so

105
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,840
the tests that we're going to do in the

106
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,670
first instance of blood tests so that's

107
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,920
just you know a prick with a needle and

108
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,840
babies of this age are normally bothered

109
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,560
by blood tests and then after that we

110
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,660
might go on in the next few days to do

111
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,040
some more tests but I can talk about

112
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,180
those if and when we need to do them

113
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,910
okay this is calmer woman that was shot

114
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,380
really I think will we be able to talk

115
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,480
to some more people later on because I'm

116
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,100
sure I have a lot of things going

117
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,200
through my head that sure well I can I

118
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,410
can leave you now just do you kind of

119
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,820
get your head around it because I know

120
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,560
that it's a lot to think about but the

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,740
essence of it is and I can just go over

122
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,310
again in simple terms if you like is

123
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,130
that we can't be sure what sex your baby

124
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,040
is this sometimes happens and it

125
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,030
sometimes turns out to be nothing okay

126
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,470
occasionally and the common lists the

127
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,870
most urgent thing for us to work out is

128
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,780
if it's a hormone problem so that's why

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,730
we're doing the blood tests and we're

130
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,520
also doing some genetic tests to look at

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,640
what sex what genetic sex the baby is so

132
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,260
if the baby's got the chromosomes of a

133
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,350
girl or a boy so they will help us so

134
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,150
we'll have much more information in a

135
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,280
day or two but we won't get those tests

136
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,290
back straight away because it takes a

137
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,140
bit of time and so just for now if you

138
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,100
can bear to it's just better if course

139
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,720
you can have the baby with you and you

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,419
can start bonding with the baby and

141
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,070
introduce the baby to everyone but just

142
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,840
we can't be sure at the moment I know

143
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,780
that's difficult but we will know in the

144
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,780
next few days but the baby is okay the

145
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,880
baby is fine and whatever it is we're

146
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,010
the bottom of it okay kind of feel a bit

147
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,500
better now least is okay it's your

148
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,130
anything else you want to ask not at the

149
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,540
moment we'll have a lot of copper I'll

150
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,170
come back I'll come back in about an

151
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,930
hour or two and we can talk about it

152
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,310
again if you want if there's some more

153
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,650
questions that come to mind Scott okay

154
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,370
thank you
","by mr. mrs. Scott hi hi I'm Chloe

McCauley I wanted the baby doctors

congratulations I understand you've just

had your first baby is that right yes

okay how you feeling happy or make these

people been in and out so they're a bit

on edge and bit confuse okay okay well

that's that's why I've come to talk to

you tell me what you understand so far

what people said to you basically after

my wife gave birth a few hours ago they

told to me was healthy but they couldn't

decide decide whether there was a girl

or boy and they normally said anything

and just whispering it okay okay you're

just confused okay well what you say is

absolutely right and I'm sorry that you

feel confused but sometimes at the

beginning things aren't clear we need a

bit of time to sort things out so that's

what we intend to do over the next few

hours and days so I've actually been to

see your baby myself as you say lots of

people whisking in and out and sometimes

when babies are born you can't be

certain what sex the baby is and it's

really important not to say one thing

and then be wrong okay in lots of cases

what you see is you know when you're

looking at baby's nappy you see

something which you're not sure is

either kind of very swollen vagina very

swollen clitoris or a very small penis

and that's the case with your baby okay

so it may be that in 24 hours the

swelling is subsides and it's very clear

that the baby is one sex or another but

for now we can't be sure what so you're

saying there's something wrong with our

baby I'm not saying that I'm not saying

there's something wrong I'm saying there

is potentially a cause for making a fact

that your baby's genitalia don't look

normal okay so what we need to do is we

need to do various tests in order to get

to the bottom of it okay so the first

thing I want to say is it may be that

every single test

do is normal and tomorrow when we look

at the baby we can say oh this is

clearly you know this is looking much

more like a boy or much more like a girl

and we store that this test to reassure

us perfectly it might be that there's

nothing wrong at all okay the test that

we do is we'll do some tests looking at

the baby's genes so to see whether the

genes are the genes of a baby girl or a

baby boy that's one of the tests that

will do and then we'll also do some

other blood tests looking at some other

salt levels in the blood because they

can sometimes be abnormal okay you say

gene gene to us does that mean it's our

fault it's a very good question and no

it definitely isn't your fault okay the

the the commonest cause for us seeing

this although is very uncommon the

Communist cause is a hormone problem

which we can pick up on the blood test

okay so that's why you want to do a

blood test it's something can manage or

is it something in life wrong I mean III

can understand you've got lots of

questions and it's a time of great

uncertainty and what we can do is we

don't know and I don't want to start

talking in great detail about the

different possibilities until we know

what it is so what we're going to do is

we're going to do two tests in the

immediate term and that's to see whether

the baby is on the phone as owners of a

0.8173611111,SCENE 5 Cross-cultural interview,https://youtu.be/5UHbkDeYYYY,Male,Adult,Male,Middle Age Adult,The patient is in another country for college and he is missing his friends and family. He is unsure about his choice of coming in a foriegn country for study.,30,The doctor listened him carefully and make him realise why and by how much difficulty he came in the foreign country. The doctor motivated the patient.,26,0:40-1:00,18:00-18:20,Suggestion,Information,missing his friends and relatives,"1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,469
I just I haven't been feeling like too

2
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:11,080
good lately I've just hung I'm not very

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,059
happy at all

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:17,950
and so I'm like my lecturer my lecture

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,080
in my course they said I should probably

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,880
come here and talk to someone okay

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,130
so you're feeling a bit unhappy and

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,320
obviously someone's nice are you saying

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:39,339
a lecture is sort of just it's like I've

10
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,400
just come over here I'm from India so I

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,610
just came here to study and so I just

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,970
finished my first semester and like I'm

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,640
missing my friends and my family so you

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,920
know they're back in India so I haven't

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,229
seen them in a while and yeah I have

16
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,890
just you know and maybe you know maybe

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,950
it's a bad idea to come here and study

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,340
so not feeling too happy but it sounds

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,930
to me in kearney from noggin is right at

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,460
the sound because it moved from India

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,460
over here they're kind of the social

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,900
thing your friends and your family and

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,420
they sort of connection seems to be lost

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,210
is no problem yeah yeah because I moved

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,850
here yeah it's only been six months and

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,720
I I really miss them like missed back

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,060
home and I thought it'll be easier to

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,830
kind of make friends and stuff here but

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:38,380
it's not by glad so yeah so I yeah I've

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,850
been just thinking about it you know

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,100
maybe I should go back oh if this is for

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,280
me okay so as kind of it sounds mean

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,110
it's a medium to climb to the moment

34
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,550
whether this has been a good decision

35
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,590
for you to come out of here or not yeah

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,780
I wanted to go back hmm

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,120
and things are so much different in Park

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,020
in India

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,670
because I went to school and then go so

40
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,040
things are only different there so I

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,190
just don't know if like if I can fit in

42
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,449

head like what's happening right now um

56
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,840
look I didn't really know what what we

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,310
were gonna do all together but I thought

58
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,330
I thought maybe you could you know give

59
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,790
me some things to me feel better things

60
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,519

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,280
maybe will help me make friends and okay

62
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,739
I don't know just you've I'm curious

63
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:04,489
about how are you all feeling

64
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,980
comfortable and talking to me about your

65
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,390
saying having difficulties with talking

66
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,760
to people out here and stuff of that not

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,310
quite we're aware that you know yeah

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,079
some security hey you feeling

69
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,820
comfortable talking to me that was happy

70
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,110
for tomorrow's it yeah yeah it's fine I

71
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,930
can I can talk about it um I guess like

72
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,700
I feel like somehow I'm up like a lower

73
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,650
lower class here

74
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,049
like compared to India like like in

75
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,560
India we have the caste system and you

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,239
know I'm from a family that's from a

77
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,850
higher cost because we Hindus and you

78
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,019
know the people in the lower class

79
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,140
you've gotta think about like they when

80
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,670
they are around higher class people they

81
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,980
don't talk immediately you know and you

82
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,600
have to be respectful and when I'm here

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,459
look I don't know when to talk and when

84
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,970
I say something it's funny or it's the

85
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,239
wrong thing so just and that makes me

86
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,269
feel

87
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,989
I'm not I need to know a little bit more

88
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,489
about India so I'm just trying to get my

89
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,099
head around that for myself so you're

90
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,379
saying that it is a car system when you

91
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,269
have higher every lower classes yeah

92
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,070
that communication between those are

93
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,389
kind of harder um I think like in India

94
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,449
cuz I'm Hindu and in Hindu we have like

95
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,330
different cars in each cars well you

96
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,800
know depends on the kind of work that

97
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,350
you do like I'm from a class that's

98
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,940
higher up and we're priests like we're

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,490
Brahmins and my priests and so we're are

100
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,169
for higher class and they used to have

101
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,389
like the people in the lower class are

102
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,150
like untouchable so they're the more

103
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,310
like the manual workers and the cleaners

104
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,039
and things like that and so there's this

105
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,510
expectation that you know when they're

106
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,949
around people I guess they should show

107
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,280
respect and not talk third of you know

108
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,240
lying and be well behaved and usually

109
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,750
they're quite uneducated and like when

110
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,010
when I'm here I kind of feel like that

111
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,620
you feel I feel yeah I don't know when

112
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,150
to say things and I'm always getting

113
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,669
things at all on the knife just and you

114
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,169
know back in India it's different you

115
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,539
know it wasn't like that just my

116
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,849
understanding gave me some examples of

117
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,620
when you feel like you've got it wrong

118
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,510
what sort of happened out here where you

119
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,479
kind of felt like you should have spoken

120
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,039
or said something differently

121
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,560
look I guess in the tutorials like you

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,349
know and it's not anything big bird you

123
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,410
know if I say something or because of my

124
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,800
accent or you know people kind of laughs

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,990
all and you know that doesn't make me

126
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,919
feel very good so even like talking to

127
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,630
people I don't know what to say because

128
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,810
I feel like we don't have anything in

129
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,620
common much so okay so just my

130
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,180
understanding am I sure we get this okay

131
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,150
this kind of right so you've been having

132
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,680
some difficulty since you come out from

133
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,270
any you've started universe

134
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,960
you and you feel there's a difference

135
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,730
that you and you're picking up on that

136
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,590
you you obviously missing your family

137
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,940
and friends which is one of the main

138
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,920
things you've talked about but also

139
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,450
there's a difference in this cultural

140
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,730
thing and everything in here there was a

141
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,410
class thing in terms of when you talked

142
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,970
and how you talk what who you talk to

143
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,840
wherever here that's not so easy and

144
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,790
you're feeling that when you do talk you

145
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,930
shouldn't have done at all yeah yeah

146
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,070
yeah

147
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,110
and it makes me feel like you know like

148
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm of a lower caste like you know like

149
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,520
I was born into that and you know like

150
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,340
I'm not like you know back in India I

151
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,910
don't know I was more important and

152
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,610
people knew what caste I was from and

153
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,430
you know and but here it's all different

154
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,400
all that's you know back home and people

155
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,610
like don't understand how I feel and

156
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,250
like even when I try to explain it

157
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,470
people don't understand it but yeah I

158
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,900
just feel like in India things were so

159
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,020
much different it was because of the

160
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,730
religion and because of the cars people

161
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,250
understood that and but when I come here

162
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,900
I feel all these things and I feel like

163
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,450
I shouldn't have to feel like the

164
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,550
comparison is here it seems a lot easier

165
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,110
for you because it seems to be a non

166
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,500
everyone kind of knows this is it's

167
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,530
given that out here it's hard of here

168
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,680
cuz it's not known and mm-hmm I'm

169
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,200
curious about how being in here makes

170
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,700
you feel of a lower class can tell me a

171
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,100
bit more about that about I don't know I

172
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,110
just feel like I don't know when to say

173
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,000
things and unsure of myself and I feel

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,620
like I've never felt like that in my

175
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,020
life

176
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,350
and and you know that those are the kind

177
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,660
of things that you know maybe in my mind

178
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,920
I think you know people of lower class

179
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,890
are thinking especially when they are on

180
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,470
people in the higher class like we have

181
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,510
many workers at home were servants and

182
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,210
they always you know the very careful

183
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,610
about what they say and what they

184
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,270
I feel like can awesome I'm like that

185
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,430
now and and I shouldn't behave I okay

186
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,289
some I'm curious about you know you're

187
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,419
saying that you're worried about what

188
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,189
you say you know you say I'm as crew

189
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,370
about our time together and with my not

190
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,439
really understanding that kind of

191
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,169
background for myself and us sort of

192
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,210
trying to I guess help and talk things

193
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,689
out and have communication I'm wondering

194
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,789
you know if I'm getting it wrong or if I

195
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,719
could do something to make it a little

196
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,419
bit easier for you or oh if you could

197
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,828
help me out with that I mean is there

198
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,529
something you're good um no no no I

199
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,070
didn't like yeah I mean I think by by

200
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,529
understanding how like things work in

201
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,899
India I think I can kind of explain you

202
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,360
can kind of understand how I feel and

203
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
yeah I think Lord of how I feel is

204
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
because of my religion and my my you

205
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,579
know my beliefs and okay

206
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,200
like I I don't know what religion you

207
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,610
are but you know a lot of people don't

208
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,890
understand that and and so I just feel

209
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,230
like no one understands me and I can't

210
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,570
talk to my parents about it because they

211
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,579
just wanted me to be okay and I don't

212
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,170
want to burden them so it's really

213
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,579
important for me I understand you that's

214
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,230
really what I understand what's

215
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,519
happening for you what's going on for

216
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
you and that sort of stuff so if there's

217
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,180
anything that we're doing together when

218
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,680
we're talking everything on those lines

219
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,209
I'd wonder if you could help you to

220
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:25,589
understand if I'm doing something that

221
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,300
making you feel a bit uncomfortable it

222
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,190
doesn't feel quite as a four-by-four you

223
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,990
okay if you could let you know that'd be

224
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,089
really helpful all right yeah I can make

225
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,680
general and then I think on top of that

226
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,850
I think there's a lot of things going

227
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,490
for you as well as this you're saying as

228
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,230
well as the knee feeling socially

229
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,360
isolated that kind of moved my friends

230
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,190
and family in that sort of stuff can

231
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,510
tell me more about what's happening with

232
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,660
that for you yes yeah I miss my friends

233
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,640
a lot I thought when I came here you

234
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,019
know I'll have different friends and

235
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,959
things will be kind of easy like you see

236
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,430
on TV but um it's not and and I feel

237
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,890
like you know maybe it wasn't the best

238
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,019
decision because I thought people be

239
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,829
friendly and people understand more but

240
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,510
you know I had a few friends but they

241
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,380
were they also left

242
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,330
I just don't feel like people understand

243
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,300
me and I think I'm a little bit angry as

244
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,180
well like I don't understand them it

245
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,550
sounds to me in crap you've not got a

246
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,430
right it has been your feeling quite

247
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,940
isolated and alone out here that people

248
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,340
really don't understand who you are and

249
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,980
when you do talk out kind of you don't

250
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,260
feel you got it right all people are

251
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,320
judging you yeah yeah yeah absolutely

252
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,990
yeah and I feel like people just yeah

253
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,790
they don't like they don't know what

254
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,420
it's like and you know maybe I don't

255
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,950
know what it's like for them but you

256
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,070
know I just feel like if they can't

257
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,760
understand that like it's the gap is too

258
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,700
big that there's so much about me that

259
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,820
don't know that I don't think we can be

260
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,940
friends or even have good friends like I

261
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,950
have back in India can you be any

262
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,890
examples where you feel that that's they

263
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,630
really understand like where you try to

264
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,030
talk to people and just talking it a bit

265
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,680
of a flavor what's been happening for

266
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,420
you that's understand yeah I guess like

267
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,910
even in class and like having

268
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,140
conversations with people at the

269
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,140
university you know I just feel like

270
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,940
whenever I talk about India they're kind

271
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,800
of laughing and I don't feel good about

272
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,630
that because you know I really missed

273
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,060
India and I really like the time I spent

274
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,160
there and when I when I say that I

275
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,080
always get that feeling that they're

276
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,300
kind of laughing at me and looking down

277
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,300
on me and I don't like I don't like that

278
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,000
and like you know I'm like in India I

279
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,950
wasn't you know they do that with people

280
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,030
in the lower class and so when when

281
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,320
you're having a conversation with

282
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,150
someone you date laughs a year it kind

283
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,830
of gives you the sense that they put you

284
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,360
into a lower class and it makes you feel

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,790
whole yeah that's to me that it's kind

286
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,290
of a back in India where they they put

287
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,930
you into a different class yeah yeah

288
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,910
kind of like uneducated or you know and

289
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm not like that and and I feel like

290
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,170
they only doing that because they don't

291
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,750
understand me and you know what Indians

292
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,050
are out there parent do you talk to any

293
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,730
one of them I have some like family

294
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,780
friends who are Indian but I feel like I

295
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,160
feel like I can't tell them that I'm

296
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,710
feeling sad I don't because there's you

297
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,740
know my parents buried all this money

298
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,710
for me to study here and if I you know

299
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,320
if I say I'm not happy then they'll feel

300
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,420
bad and you know that's a lot of money

301
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,330
Western so so the people that you feel

302
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,030
you can talk to you also can't because

303
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,890
of feeling like you get back to your

304
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,080
parents and there'd be a sense of sounds

305
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,770
like disappointment that money yeah yeah

306
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,520
so I don't know thanks very difficult

307
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,700
doesn't it when you've got yeah yeah so

308
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,290
I just feel like no one understands and

309
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,640
you know I can't really talk to anyone

310
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,730
and um and so I guess that's why I feel

311
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,720
isolated and yeah and don't have many

312
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,970
friends

313
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,630
so a lot of it could be come down to how

314
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,890
when your talk with people that sort of

315
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,260
stuff how it ends up making you feel mmm

316
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,700
what kind of outcomes that give to you

317
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
what when you do feel like you're being

318
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,760
put into a large class work what do you

319
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,770
didn't do I don't feel like doing

320
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,850
anything at all

321
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,280
like I just think you know what's the

322
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,339
point of doing this I was really

323
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,160
interested in my course and now I just

324
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,410
am NOT I'm really bored in the lectures

325
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,560
and like even the assignments I don't

326
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,800
feel like going I just think what's the

327
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,490
point and

328
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,500
like in the mornings when I wake up I

329
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,510
just feel really heavy and sad just I

330
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,029
don't feel like doing anything

331
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,450
so it seems it's spreading to other

332
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,700
areas as well that the ability not about

333
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,130
of socialize and feel connected as sort

334
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,930
of taking the passion areas studies and

335
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,899
about of silence and not feeling

336
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,610
motivated to do anything it seems to me

337
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,800
which is I'm just trying to that right

338
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,980
for myself is that kind of the call I

339
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,880
think it might be I think it might be I

340
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,010
think yeah I think like you're saying

341
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,810
maybe you know maybe because I don't

342
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,839
have friends and I'm not I'm not you

343
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,570
know and I'm feeling like unhappy and

344
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,300
stuff it's why I'm doing you know

345
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,320
there's no look I don't feel motivated

346
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,660
like there's no like I don't want to get

347
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,000
up and do things and I think you might

348
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,890
be right I think it may be because you

349
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,209
know I'm feeling unhappy about my

350
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,029
circumstances so feeling unhappy is sort

351
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,180
of the motivation to do things the

352
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,560
ability to sort of get on your

353
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,290
assignments and study here yeah yeah and

354
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,510
I want to do well like my parents have

355
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,330
paid all this money and I really want to

356
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:19,110
do well in my knowledge they study how

357
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,180
does the parents paying for things have

358
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,650
enough thank you I mean you just met him

359
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,060
there that your parents paid all this

360
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,459
money as well about that yeah like my

361
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,860
family are from sort of middle class

362
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,930
upper middle class kind of family and my

363
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,810
father's worked very hard you know to

364
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,029
try and get some money for me to come to

365
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,450
Australia and so you know I was very

366
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,400
excited about it and I'm you know I feel

367
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,130
like I have to work very hard to pay

368
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,829
them back and you know grow up and maybe

369
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,089
take care of them and bring them back

370
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,959
here and you know but and so I feel a

371
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,480
bit selfish because I you know I'm just

372
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,440
complaining about friends and but at the

373
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,790
same time I just feel like no one

374
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,070
understands me because what it has

375
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,010
sounds to this expectation I get placed

376
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,190
on YouTube to do well your consent how

377
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,080
you to do well if you had a look after

378
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,630
on but there's it's hard to do well when

379
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,120
you're feeling saying isolated and

380
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,040
different out here temperature

381
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,510
communicating with people and things

382
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,290
along those lines

383
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,650
so this as you're saying it sounds that

384
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,210
there's a bit of you know feel a bit

385
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,860
selfish a bit bad by complaining about

386
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,900
this crappy they've spent all this money

387
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,450
to send me out here and in India it's

388
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,130
not like here you know you have to work

389
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,430
very hard like my father's had to work

390
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,260
his whole life to kind of save up money

391
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,950
for me to come here and I feel I don't

392
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,370
know like slightly a responsible so you

393
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,260
know I should be happy coming last rally

394
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm doing university studies but you

395
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,050
know just not it's not it hasn't turned

396
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,640
out to be the way I thought it would be

397
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,070
and I don't want to tell my parents that

398
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,760
because you know then they're you know

399
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,740
they'll be disappointed that if I went

400
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,210
back home I wouldn't get as good a job

401
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,750
and there's this massive expectation by

402
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,730
the sounds of things even placing on

403
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,319
yourself that they'd be disappointed if

404
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,270
I didn't do it really well if you

405
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,800
mentioned earlier that's been half you

406
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,089
do really well when you're feeling so

407
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,950
isolated that's kind of another sticky

408
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,849
thing there for you

409
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,510
yeah yeah I guess it is you know and I

410
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,760
just yeah I just don't see a real way

411
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,770
out but at the same time just don't I

412
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,820
don't know how I can keep going like

413
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,230
I've only finished one semester and the

414
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,200
courses you know three years long I just

415
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,720
want to go back home all the time and we

416
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,370
can't really afford for me to go back

417
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,810
home and so I did I feel really stuck

418
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,840
and yeah yeah what happenes been looking

419
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,970
this point in time so our panelists

420
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,650
pressures and expectations of doing bad

421
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,960
here and doing a degree there's also the

422
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
social pressures of not feeling like

423
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,799
you're feeling in yeah feeling hard to

424
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,840
connect with people muscular stuff going

425
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,460
back home it's kind of what you really

426
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,980
want to do but there's a sense of has

427
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,380
been sent out here to to do something to

428
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,970
get something so imagine you feeling

429
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,020
quite stuck in my sideline yeah

430
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,630
and somehow like I feel like a corn

431
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:31,590
improve why I just don't I don't know I

432
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,230
mean I didn't like like you understand

433
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,000
you know when I tell you how I feel but

434
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,740
you know I don't know if other people

435
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,960
will understand that right as much so

436
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,179
what is it about us talking that makes

437
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,059
you feel that you mean main positive in

438
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,429
you telling me stuff really well can

439
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,559
understand what you saying so I'm just

440
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,390
curious about our process has what's

441
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,620
been happening here to make you feel

442
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,380
that I've understood you know I guess I

443
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,840
just I feel like you're not laughing at

444
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,600
me like you really want to know about

445
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
like about India and you know but what

446
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,179
what's been happening like for me and my

447
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,179
family but with other people I think

448
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,740
it's different compared to that but yeah

449
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,330
I think like there are some nice people

450
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,210
but I think what if if people kind of

451
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,799
let stop and listen and if then you're a

452
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,929
little more than energy you see so when

453
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,370
people pay attention to you and listen

454
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,990
to all you have to say you feel a little

455
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,380
bit more at ease about the communication

456
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,809
thing yeah I guess yeah

","I just I haven't been feeling like too

good lately I've just hung I'm not very

happy at all

and so I'm like my lecturer my lecture

in my course they said I should probably

come here and talk to someone okay

so you're feeling a bit unhappy and

obviously someone's nice are you saying

a lecture is sort of just it's like I've

just come over here I'm from India so I

just came here to study and so I just

finished my first semester and like I'm

missing my friends and my family so you

know they're back in India so I haven't

seen them in a while and yeah I have

just you know and maybe you know maybe

it's a bad idea to come here and study

so not feeling too happy but it sounds

to me in kearney from noggin is right at

the sound because it moved from India

over here they're kind of the social

thing your friends and your family and

they sort of connection seems to be lost

is no problem yeah yeah because I moved

here yeah it's only been six months and

I I really miss them like missed back

home and I thought it'll be easier to

kind of make friends and stuff here but

it's not by glad so yeah so I yeah I've

been just thinking about it you know

maybe I should go back oh if this is for

me okay so as kind of it sounds mean

it's a medium to climb to the moment

whether this has been a good decision

for you to come out of here or not yeah

I wanted to go back hmm

and things are so much different in Park

in India

because I went to school and then go so

things are only different there so I

just don't know if like if I can fit in

here as well

and like even talking to people like I

had very little in common with them so

it must been half year gets to come in

today as well if you're I had to opened

a paper all my kind of stuff so with

coming up from a new something you know

it's it's different

mm you know the difference to coming out

here you tell me a little bit about

what's happening for you now and talking

to me and how's that

what other thing is going through your

head like what's happening right now um

look I didn't really know what what we

were gonna do all together but I thought

I thought maybe you could you know give

me some things to me feel better things

and tell me to do things that you know

maybe will help me make friends and okay

I don't know just you've I'm curious

about how are you all feeling

comfortable and talking to me about your

saying having difficulties with talking

to people out here and stuff of that not

quite we're aware that you know yeah

some security hey you feeling

comfortable talking to me that was happy

for tomorrow's it yeah yeah it's fine I

can I can talk about it um I guess like

I feel like somehow I'm up like a lower

lower class here

like compared to India like like in

India we have the caste system and you

know I'm from a family that's from a

higher cost because we Hindus and you

know the people in the lower class

you've gotta think about like they when

they are around higher class people they

don't talk immediately you know and you

have to be respectful and when I'm here

look I don't know when to talk and when

I say something it's funny or it's the

wrong thing so just and that makes me

feel

I'm not I need to know a little bit more

about India so I'm just trying to get my

head around that for myself so you're

saying that it is a car system when you

have higher every lower classes yeah

that communication between those are

kind of harder um I think like in India

cuz I'm Hindu and in Hindu we have like

different cars in each cars well you

know depends on the kind of work that

you do like I'm from a class that's

higher up and we're priests like we're

Brahmins and my priests and so we're are

for higher class and they used to have

like the people in the lower class are

like untouchable so they're the more

like the manual workers and the cleaners

and things like that and so there's this

expectation that you know when they're

around people I guess they should show

respect and not talk third of you know

lying and be well behaved and usually

they're quite uneducated and like when

when I'm here I kind of feel like that

you feel I feel yeah I don't know when

to say things and I'm always getting

things at all on the knife just and you

know back in India it's different you

know it wasn't like that just my

understanding gave me some examples of

when you feel like you've got it wrong

what sort of happened out here where you

kind of felt like you should have spoken

or said something differently

look I guess in the tutorials like you

know and it's not anything big bird you

know if I say something or because of my

accent or you know people kind of laughs

all and you know that doesn't make me

feel very good so even like talking to

people I don't know what to say because

I feel like we don't have anything in

common much so okay so just my

understanding am I sure we get this okay

this kind of right so you've been having

some difficulty since you come out from

any you've started universe

you and you feel there's a difference

that you and you're picking up on that

you you obviously missing your family

and friends which is one of the main

things you've talked about but also

there's a difference in this cultural

thing and everything in here there was a

class thing in terms of when you talked

and how you talk what who you talk to

wherever here that's not so easy and

you're feeling that when you do talk you

shouldn't have done at all yeah yeah

yeah

and it makes me feel like you know like

I'm of a lower caste like you know like

I was born into that and you know like

I'm not like you know back in India I

don't know I was more important and

people knew what caste I was from and

you know and but here it's all different

all that's you know back home and people

like don't understand how I feel and

like even when I try to explain it

people don't understand it but yeah I

just feel like in India things were so

much different it was because of the

religion and because of the cars people

understood that and but when I come here

I feel all these things and I feel like

I shouldn't have to feel like the

comparison is here it seems a lot easier

for you because it seems to be a non

everyone kind of knows this is it's

given that out here it's hard of here

cuz it's not known and mm-hmm I'm

curious about how being in here makes

you feel of a lower class can tell me a

bit more about that about I don't know I

just feel like I don't know when to say

things and unsure of myself and I feel

like I've never felt like that in my

life

and and you know that those are the kind

of things that you know maybe in my mind

I think you know people of lower class

are thinking especially when they are on

people in the higher class like we have

many workers at home were servants and

they always you know the very careful

about what they say and what they

I feel like can awesome I'm like that

now and and I shouldn't behave I okay

some I'm curious about you know you're

saying that you're worried about what

you say you know you say I'm as crew

about our time together and with my not

really understanding that kind of

background for myself and us sort of

trying to I guess help and talk things

out and have communication I'm wondering

you know if I'm getting it wrong or if I

could do something to make it a little

bit easier for you or oh if you could

help me out with that I mean is there

something you're good um no no no I

didn't like yeah I mean I think by by

understanding how like things work in

India I think I can kind of explain you

can kind of understand how I feel and

yeah I think Lord of how I feel is

because of my religion and my my you

know my beliefs and okay

like I I don't know what religion you

are but you know a lot of people don't

understand that and and so I just feel

like no one understands me and I can't

talk to my parents about it because they

just wanted me to be okay and I don't

want to burden them so it's really

important for me I understand you that's

really what I understand what's

happening for you what's going on for

you and that sort of stuff so if there's

anything that we're doing together when

we're talking everything on those lines

I'd wonder if you could help you to

understand if I'm doing something that

making you feel a bit uncomfortable it

doesn't feel quite as a four-by-four you

okay if you could let you know that'd be

really helpful all right yeah I can make

general and then I think on top of that

I think there's a lot of things going

for you as well as this you're saying as

well as the knee feeling socially

isolated that kind of moved my friends

and family in that sort of stuff can

tell me more about what's happening with

that for you yes yeah I miss my friends

a lot I thought when I came here you

know I'll have different friends and

things will be kind of easy like you see

on TV but um it's not and and I feel

like you know maybe it wasn't the best

decision because I thought people be

friendly and people understand more but

you know I had a few friends but they

were they also left

I just don't feel like people understand

me and I think I'm a little bit angry as

well like I don't understand them it

sounds to me in crap you've not got a

right it has been your feeling quite

isolated and alone out here that people

really don't understand who you are and

when you do talk out kind of you don't

feel you got it right all people are

judging you yeah yeah yeah absolutely

yeah and I feel like people just yeah

they don't like they don't know what

it's like and you know maybe I don't

know what it's like for them but you

know I just feel like if they can't

understand that like it's the gap is too

big that there's so much about me that

don't know that I don't think we can be

friends or even have good friends like I

have back in India can you be any

examples where you feel that that's they

really understand like where you try to

talk to people and just talking it a bit

of a flavor what's been happening for

you that's understand yeah I guess like

even in class and like having

conversations with people at the

university you know I just feel like

whenever I talk about India they're kind

of laughing and I don't feel good about

that because you know I really missed

India and I really like the time I spent

there and when I when I say that I

always get that feeling that they're

kind of laughing at me and looking down

on me and I don't like I don't like that

and like you know I'm like in India I

wasn't you know they do that with people

in the lower class and so when when

you're having a conversation with

someone you date laughs a year it kind

of gives you the sense that they put you

into a lower class and it makes you feel

whole yeah that's to me that it's kind

of a back in India where they they put

you into a different class yeah yeah

kind of like uneducated or you know and

I'm not like that and and I feel like

they only doing that because they don't

understand me and you know what Indians

are out there parent do you talk to any

one of them I have some like family

friends who are Indian but I feel like I

feel like I can't tell them that I'm

feeling sad I don't because there's you

know my parents buried all this money

for me to study here and if I you know

if I say I'm not happy then they'll feel

bad and you know that's a lot of money

Western so so the people that you feel

you can talk to you also can't because

of feeling like you get back to your

parents and there'd be a sense of sounds

like disappointment that money yeah yeah

so I don't know thanks very difficult

doesn't it when you've got yeah yeah so

I just feel like no one understands and

you know I can't really talk to anyone

and um and so I guess that's why I feel

isolated and yeah and don't have many

friends

so a lot of it could be come down to how

when your talk with people that sort of

stuff how it ends up making you feel mmm

what kind of outcomes that give to you

what when you do feel like you're being

put into a large class work what do you

didn't do I don't feel like doing

anything at all

like I just think you know what's the

point of doing this I was really

interested in my course and now I just

am NOT I'm really bored in the lectures

and like even the assignments I don't

feel like going I just think what's the

point and

like in the mornings when I wake up I

just feel really heavy and sad just I

don't feel like doing anything

so it seems it's spreading to other

areas as well that the ability not about

of socialize and feel connected as sort

of taking the passion areas studies and

about of silence and not feeling

motivated to do anything it seems to me

which is I'm just trying to that right

for myself is that kind of the call I

think it might be I think it might be I

think yeah I think like you're saying

maybe you know maybe because I don't

have friends and I'm not I'm not you

know and I'm feeling like unhappy and

stuff it's why I'm doing you know

there's no look I don't feel motivated

like there's no like I don't want to get

up and do things and I think you might

be right I think it may be because you

know I'm feeling unhappy about my

circumstances so feeling unhappy is sort

of the motivation to do things the

ability to sort of get on your

assignments and study here yeah yeah and

I want to do well like my parents have

paid all this money and I really want to

do well in my knowledge they study how

does the parents paying for things have

enough thank you I mean you just met him

there that your parents paid all this

money as well about that yeah like my

family are from sort of middle class

upper middle class kind of family and my

father's worked very hard you know to

try and get some money for me to come to

Australia and so you know I was very

excited about it and I'm you know I feel

like I have to work very hard to pay

them back and you know grow up and maybe

take care of them and bring them back

here and you know but and so I feel a

bit selfish because I you know I'm just

complaining about friends and but at the

same time I just feel like no one

understands me because what it has

sounds to this expectation I get placed

on YouTube to do well your consent how

you to do well if you had a look after

on but there's it's hard to do well when

you're feeling saying isolated and

different out here temperature

communicating with people and things

along those lines

so this as you're saying it sounds that

there's a bit of you know feel a bit

selfish a bit bad by complaining about

this crappy they've spent all this money

to send me out here and in India it's

not like here you know you have to work

very hard like my father's had to work

his whole life to kind of save up money

for me to come here and I feel I don't

know like slightly a responsible so you

know I should be happy coming last rally

I'm doing university studies but you

know just not it's not it hasn't turned

out to be the way I thought it would be

and I don't want to tell my parents that

because you know then they're you know

they'll be disappointed that if I went

back home I wouldn't get as good a job

and there's this massive expectation by

the sounds of things even placing on

yourself that they'd be disappointed if

I didn't do it really well if you

mentioned earlier that's been half you

do really well when you're feeling so

isolated that's kind of another sticky

thing there for you

yeah yeah I guess it is you know and I

just yeah I just don't see a real way

out but at the same time just don't I

don't know how I can keep going like

I've only finished one semester and the

courses you know three years long I just

want to go back home all the time and we

can't really afford for me to go back

home and so I did I feel really stuck

and yeah yeah what happenes been looking

this point in time so our panelists

pressures and expectations of doing bad

what is it about us talking that makes

curious about our process has what's

been happening here to make you feel

that I've understood you know I guess I

just I feel like you're not laughing at

me like you really want to know about

like about India and you know but what

what's been happening like for me and my

family but with other people I think

it's different compared to that but yeah

I think like there are some nice people

but I think what if if people kind of

let stop and listen and if then you're a

little more than energy you see so when

people pay attention to you and listen

to all you have to say you feel a little

bit more at ease about the communication

thing yeah I guess yeah

headache and I quit all right

49
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,840

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,890
are you forgetful yes yeah so I'm gonna

54
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,980
move to another series of questions all

right do you pitch it yes you do I do do

56
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,850

60
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:22,209
while you know go back sit down and on

61
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,389
my system click we're good

62
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,400

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,350
stand up and walk around yes and then

64
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,780
you can sit down and resume yeah how do

65
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,579

that's always running yes yeah

71
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,150

yes I do

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,610
how about blurting things out yes but

75
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,240
people don't really notice it because

76
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,890
especially at class I'll like yell out

77
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,360
the answer but you have to hit a button

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,738
and hit a button so that okay Ernie's on

79
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,139
and the audio transit alright so you'll

80
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,240
you'll blurt something out but they

81
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,190
won't hear it yeah they won't because

82
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,260
you have it so I guess that's good okay

83
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,260
okay how about interrupting people yes

84
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,050

stay in bed and I just think you know

38
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,459
maybe I did leave a door locked and then

39
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,250
I just keep thinking that maybe it isn't

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,959
locked so it kind of keeps cycling

41
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,620
through this same yeah do you ever do

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,100
anything to try get those thoughts to go

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,860
away like focusing on something else

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,590
well I have like a ceiling fan above me

45
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,560
so sometimes I'll just like count how

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,799
many times it goes around and just try

47
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,810
to distract myself from thinking about

48
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,299
it but I still think about the door

49
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,910
being unlocked sometimes it helps

50
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,790
all right so you have you have a fear

51
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,960
that somebody is going to enter break in

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,040
to where you live and you're staying up

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,630
at night thinking about whether the

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,570
doors been secured

55
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,180
that's been that's been showing you

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,810
anything else um sometimes if I'm

57
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,750
leaving for work I'll get to my car and

58
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,520
I'll think I got the hair straightener

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,940
woman and I think to myself should I go

60
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,010
back I don't know what to do and I'll

61
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,740
just like kind of debate whether or not

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,530
I should just go double-check I'm just

63
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,180
worried that if I let the straightener

64
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,900
on something you know that would happen

65
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,680
you think might happen well I mean if I

66
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,050
left the strainer on something you know

67
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,840
it's if I have like clothes or something

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,490
it's it's on a cloth like that could

69
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,120
burn or if it's I just don't want

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,040
anything I don't want the place to run

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,110
down there

72
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,430
so when you leave you're thinking about

73
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,930
it was a hair straightener yeah you're

74
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,660
thinking about whether you unplugged it

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,370
or not or turn it off or not

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,080
yeah and how long those thoughts go on

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,580
for well normally I think about it

78
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,769
before I get to my car now but maybe I

79
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,089
should just go just to make sure I'm

80
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,548
plugged it and I turned it off and then

81
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,910
sometimes during the day I'll be at work

82
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,530
and I can't focus just because I'm

83
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,210
thinking about I'll come back and I'll

84
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,130
see you know my apartment burned down so

85
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,580
that's the straightener plugged in

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,260
alright so I remember with the door

87
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,590
you're saying that you you stuck with

88
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,940
those thoughts but you don't get up and

89
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,590
check the door have you ever come back

90
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,440
and checked to see if some of those left

91
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,169
align no I I have it but I just I think

92
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,990
about it like what if I did leave it if

93
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,840
I didn't leave it on earth it

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,280
so you're worried anxious yeah

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,760
afraid yeah definitely offering and how

96
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,070
how often does this happen like the

97
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,450
cycle of thoughts probably throughout

98
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,720
the day so every day every day

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,639
yeah and how long has this been going on

100
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,540
um from ever since I moved I guess into

101
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,210
the apartment I'm so about I guess a

102
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,660
year

103
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,639
this is Pacific going off for a year

104
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,390
yeah and in that year timeframe has it

105
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:46,340
become any worse yeah yeah how did it

106
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,710
start out um it started out with just

107
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,250
you know I would go to bed and I would

108
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,080
wake up in the night and think to myself

109
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,210
tonight thought the door I'm pretty sure

110
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,790
I locked the door and then I would just

111
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,380
be fine I could go back to sleep and be

112
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,590
like no I remember I loved it but then

113
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,900
as it progressed I really I would wake

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,270
up multiple times that night and I would

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,930

in the middle of the night and I'll

think that I locked the door is the door

locked

how long does it take you to fall back

to sleep sometimes it takes me an hour -

and what are you thinking about during

that time I'm just worried that I left

the door unlocked and sometimes

sounds nothing maybe someone's in the

apartment or I just I get nervous I just

get scared for the door no mom

hours

you stay away yeah it's a lot yeah this

is this is troubling for you have you

ever got nothing check the door no I I

think bed and I just try to I but I just

thinking about it does it get worse as

that time goes on or does it get better

what happens it gets it gets worse I

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,810

not being in it so you're thinking about

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,799
it it's not that you've committed or

55
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,359
decided that you absolutely want to

56
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,670
leave the relationship but correct me if

57
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,950
I'm wrong what you're saying is you want

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,100
to make a change and you don't want this

59
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,210
relationship as it is

60
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,330
and now what what are you think about

61
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,300
changing what what ideas I mean I guess

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,030
you mentioned leaving what other

63
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,250
possibilities or thoughts have you had

64
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,590
about change and what that might look

65
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,670
like I don't know it just feels so

66
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,110
overwhelming when I think about it I

67
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,880
just I can't seem to find a way out of

68
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,230
it and that feels feels ethical it feels

69
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,180
like it and you know I don't want to

70
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,760
hurt her I just don't want to be in this

71
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,370
relationship anymore why don't you want

72
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,010
to be in this relationship anymore it's

73
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,890
not healthy it's I'm not happy I can't

74
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,270
imagine that she's happy even though she

75
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,900
says she is it's you know we're fighting

76
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,850
constantly I feel like I'm walking on

77
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,810
eggshells with her she's overprotective

78
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,780
she yeah it just it doesn't feel right

79
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,340
it just doesn't feel right it doesn't

80
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,430
feel right yeah and so so what would

81
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,220
feel right oh that's a huge question hmm

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,460
I just don't I'm not sure just this

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,240
isn't right so the way things are is not

84
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,520
right it's not working you don't feel

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,140
supported this isn't the kind of

86
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,660
relationship that that you want or that

87
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,180
you had hoped that it would be yeah I

88
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,950
mean when we started it was it was

89
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,920
lovely she is amazing she was just super

90
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,310
caring and thoughtful woman and you know

91
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,649
we were not the same interests you know

92
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,960
same friends it's you know she was just

93
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,010
fantastic and I don't know I don't know

94
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,570
where that changed and I feel like we

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,870
did this on again off again stuff and

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,300
it's just it just seems like just not

97
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,360
right um I know I know I don't deserve

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,400
to be treated this way I know that I'm

99
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,660
I'm better than that

100
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,930
mm-hmm you really value your self and

101
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,600
your well-being and in your spirit and

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,460
it sounds like you don't feel like

103
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,940
you're taking good care of yourself by

104
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,640
staying in this relationship and even

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,940
though things started out well they

106
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,680
haven't turned out to be the kind of

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,560
relationship that you want for yourself

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,920
no but you know but she's lovely and I

109
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,620
love her and I can't imagine I can't

110
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,080
imagine my life without her in it so

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,540
you're feeling torn yeah you're you're

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,100
torn between your love and affection for

113
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,000
her and your sense of honoring yourself

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,430
and you've got a lot of mixed feelings

115
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,970
and you are saying that you need

116
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,550
something to change that sounds like

117
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,180
you're able to kind of hold that

118
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,280
complexity if you will that you've got

119
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,310
these strong feelings for this person

120
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,100
and you don't feel like this is the a

121
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,850
good relationship for you no I think

122
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,650
it's good for either one of us mm-hmm

123
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,580
for both of you yeah well so so then

124
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,080
you've talked a little bit about leaving

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,780
I mean tell me more about what you've

126
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,250
thought about and when you think about

127
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,740
making a change in terms of leaving what

128
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,480
what might that look like for you I

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,850
don't know I mean it feels I just can't

130
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,520
imagine my life without her in it so the

131
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,050
idea of not having her there feels

132
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,850
really scary and the idea of staying the

133
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,610
way it is and things not changing feels

134
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,790
even scarier so I don't I don't know how

135
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,860
to and I don't even know how I would do

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,950
that our lives are so intertwined I mean

137
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,950
my business our friends our the queer

138
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,650
community is so small you know that's my

139
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,060
fam those are as much as my friends

140
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,970
that's my family as well and so just you

141
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,210
know how do you how do you extract

142
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,850
yourself from that in a way you know for

143
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,760
me like in a way that I feel I'm doing

144
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,190
that with grace and

145
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,210
respect for her and respect for myself

146
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,950
what what thoughts do you have about how

147
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,660
you do that how do you extract yourself

148
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,820
how might you extract yourself in a way

149
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,050
that has some integrity and grace as you

150
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,470
said I don't I don't even know I mean

151
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,280
talk to my friend Jay about it and I

152
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,900
don't know he suggested like a break but

153
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,370
I don't I don't know I just don't want

154
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,500
to get caught in that on-again-off-again

155
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,330
before like you know like we've done

156
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,990
before and but the idea of a break feels

157
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,210
a little less I don't know maybe more

158
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,480
gentle mm-hmm I don't know say more a

159
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
little more gentle

160
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,430
I don't know how to give us both time to

161
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,770
really think about it and and I don't

162
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,070
know maybe maybe she'll change maybe

163
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,360
maybe if I'm you know if this is it if

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,040
this is it like if this break is it

165
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,770
maybe maybe she'll be able to change

166
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,180
mm-hmm I heard you say that live you

167
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,130
know moving on and having a life without

168
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,530
Kelly is really scary in fact it's

169
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,830
almost impossible for you to imagine

170
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,880
what that would look like especially

171
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,590
with the way that your lives are so

172
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,830
intertwined I also heard you say that

173
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,590
the thought of not making a change is

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,740
scarier and I was wondering if you could

175
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,200
say a little bit more about what you

176
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,740
mean by that it's just I feel exhausted

177
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,059
I feel like I'm not I'm not who I was

178
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,700
when I came into this relationship I

179
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,770
feel like I'm constantly struggling to

180
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,049
make her happy and that just doesn't

181
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,800
work there's nothing I can do and I feel

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,910
like I've lost my joy mm-hmm

183
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,150
and I don't know I'm just afraid of what

184
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,920
will happen if I just keep staying in a

185
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,340
place where I feel like I'm falling

186
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,910
apart mm-hmm my piece yeah so you're

187
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,040
concerned about your own well-being in

188
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,100
your own joy and your your spirit if you

189
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,950
you stay and don't make this change and

190
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,170
that's the part that's really scary for

191
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,230
you yeah you mentioned that your friend

192
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,430
suggested possibly taking a little break

193
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,870
and you said that that was a scary

194
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,660
thought for you and I guess I'd like to

195
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,600
hear more additional thoughts you might

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
have about that as a as an option for

197
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,779
you

198
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,010
well I did it seems like I mean if it

199
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,540
could happen if we could find a way to

200
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,410
make it happen that it would be it would

201
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,910
just give me some time to think about

202
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,910
like what I want and what I need and and

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:50,029
you know I feel like I can't sort out

204
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,680
what's me in this anymore

205
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,709
mm-hmm and and so like if I had that

206
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,050
space just to sort of breathe and not

207
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,000
have to worry about her feelings and

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,100
taking care of her and just being able

209
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,519
to focus on myself for a little while I

210
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,779
don't know it seems like that would be

211
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,910
helpful it sounds like you're feeling

212
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,510
like you're so in in it just so in the

213
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,240
the mixed emotions and the sense of

214
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,980
hopelessness and sadness and

215
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,690
disappointment that it's really hard for

216
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,440
you to see out of it and an advantage a

217
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,540
reason to take a break would be just to

218
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,610
give you a moment to breathe and look

219
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,060
around and collect yourself and not be

220
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,230
so stuck in that ambivalence if you will

221
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,860
that sense of not knowing yeah well if

222
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,269
you don't mind I'd love to ask you to

223
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,459
take a look at this ruler here I just

224
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,990
kind of wrote this down really quickly

225
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,260
but on a scale of zero to ten zero being

226
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,360
not motivated at all and ten being

227
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,970
extremely motivated how motivated would

228
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,360
you say you are to take a break in your

229
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,149
relationship right now oh like six six

230
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,760
so somewhat motivated yeah why is six

231
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,069
and not a one because I know it needs I

232
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:11,040
need it I feel like I'm losing myself so

233
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,029
I feel like it's important yeah well so

234
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:19,160
so why a six and not a nine or ten

235
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,329
because I'm not sure how to make it

236
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:26,190
happen mmm yeah I don't I don't know so

237
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,980
it's important to you and you're not

238
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,970
maybe fully

239
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,519
confident or sure about how the how part

240
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,189
yeah how to make it well kind of

241
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:36,959
following up on that on a scale of zero

242
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,180
to ten zero being not confident at all

243
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,850
ten being extremely confident how

244
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,819
confident are you that if you decided to

245
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,589
take a break from your relationship with

246
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,199
Kelly you would be successful at making

247
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:49,829
that happen

248
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,490
oh I don't know maybe like a three or

249
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,189
four okay so so less confident or a

250
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,540
little less confident than you are

251
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,399
motivated why a three and not a zero

252
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,279
because I I'm on it I mean I do it's

253
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,310
something I want mm-hmm and so wanting

254
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,420
it makes you feel confident that you

255
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,529
confident to some extent that you could

256
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:14,699
actually make it happen

257
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,600
yeah why a three and not an eight or a

258
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,209
nine I can't control her I don't know

259
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,699
how she would react and I just don't

260
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,230
want any more arguments and anger and

261
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,410
yeah and I don't want to hurt her so so

262
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,500
when you think about taking this break

263
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,050
you're also thinking about how shy she

264
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,300
might respond and what she might do and

265
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,970
that creates a whole other kind of set

266
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,420
of worries yeah it undermines your sense

267
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,809
of confidence on some level it creates a

268
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,209
lot of anxiety for me yeah what do you

269
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:56,579
think needs to be different in order for

270
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,720
you to feel more confident about

271
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,639
successfully being able to take a brief

272
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,220
break I think and like maybe a plan like

273
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,670
just knowing knowing what the rules are

274
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,579
sort of like where where where I want to

275
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,709
go with it and and what I'm whole I

276
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,139
don't know what I want to accomplish so

277
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,720
thinking through an actual plan like

278
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,629
what you would say how long what the

279
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,809
boundaries are might might help you yeah

280
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,790
that regard okay and then one final

281
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,089
question on a scale of zero to ten zero

282
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,519
being not ready at all and ten being

283
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,160
extremely ready how ready would you say

284
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,529
you are to commit to taking some kind

285
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,379
brief break and that let's say the next

286
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:52,279
couple of weeks yeah so so pretty ready

287
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,040
yeah and and you've spoken to this

288
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,749
already a little bit I believe but I'll

289
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:59,029
ask you again why and eight and not a

290
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,170
one or two because I know if I just let

291
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,199
it drag out that I'm gonna be miserable

292
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,089
so your sense of readiness is actually

293
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,839
really connected to your motivation that

294
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,759
is that this is something you know that

295
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,699
you need to do for yourself and if you

296
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,920
don't things are not going to get any

297
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,899
better and that that makes you both

298
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,589
motivated and even more ready well why

299
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,879
why an eighth and not a ten that's you

300
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,079
know it's scary and change is hard and

301
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,660
thinking about not being with the woman

302
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,990
I thought I was going to marry that's

303
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,259
that makes me sad so your emotions your

304
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:47,389
sense of maybe sadness and in grief and

305
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,120
disappointment around this detract from

306
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,930
your sense of readiness and in some way

307
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,579
sort of given up on a dream yeah and so

308
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,779
another aspect of enter your whole

309
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,959
experiences that your your grieving the

310
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,399
really should should be isn't even over

311
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,730
yet but your grieving the dream and the

312
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,670
hopes that you had and that's a that's a

313
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,709
heaviness and that's certainly a factor

314
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,850
and and what you do next well if I could

315
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,290
take just a moment and make sure I've

316
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,790
captured and understood everything

317
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,889
you've shared with me and I I know this

318
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,809
is really difficult to talk about so I

319
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,449
really appreciate you spending the time

320
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:28,939
to share with me with what this has been

321
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:33,069
like for you you've been feeling stuck

322
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:36,110
and things were great for a while you

323
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,399
had some hope that things were gonna

324
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,429
change and now you were realizing that

325
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,949
Kelly is not going to change and that

326
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,649
you were suffering in the process that

327
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,230
you are really being kept from your

328
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,300
aspirations in your dreams

329
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,000
in a lot of different regards you know

330
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,740
that you need to make a change you want

331
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,529
to make a change

332
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,540
and you have a lot of mixed feelings

333
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,749
about this change you know it's what you

334
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:03,639
want to do it's the right thing for you

335
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,569
and you still really care and love Kelly

336
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,230
and you're also concerned kind of on an

337
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,110
outer level about your business about

338
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,089
your community about your family and

339
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,920
your friends and how they may be

340
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,939
affected by a breakup in order to make

341
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,740
this more manageable you're thinking

342
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,749
maybe in terms of smaller change like

343
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,569
taking a small break as opposed to

344
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,269
breaking off the relationship and you

345
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,309
feel like you're pretty ready you're

346
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:36,220
somewhat you know you're motivated and

347
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,350
it may be a little less confident but

348
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,819
you also said that if you were able to

349
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:42,519
maybe think through a concrete plan that

350
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,519
that might help you feel more confident

351
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,559
yeah and that's certainly something that

352
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,600
we could do together next time we meet

353
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,759
if that's all right with you I'd be

354
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,910
happy to hear your ideas maybe even

355
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,680
share some suggestions with you about a

356
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,379
possible plan that'd be alright yeah

357
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:01,720
yeah thank you thank you very much for

358
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,399
your time Liv I really appreciate it

359
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,919
you
","in this scenario client meets with a

domestic violence advocate for a local

agency that provides low-cost to no-cost

counseling for individuals and their

families this is the fourth time that

they have met the client has been in her

relationship for two years she does not

have children the violence has taken all

shapes and forms she wants to break up

with her partner and is not quite sure

how to do so she does not fear for her

life if she breaks up but she is

concerned that her partner would make

problems for her at work and in her

community

hi Liz hi welcome back thank you how are

you I'm feeling pretty intense things

have kind of gone downhill since I was

here last time well I'm sorry to hear

that yeah I know last time we talked you

and Kelly had just gotten engaged and

you were rather excited about plans that

you've had for your life so so tell me

what has happened what what is what's

shifted I think that we've just sort of

fallen back you know I was really

hopeful that you know what the proposal

also came the the promise to you know

work on the relationship and work on

anger and work on you know being the the

couple that we we hope to be and that

it's not happening mmm it's not

happening we're right back to where we

were

I'm sorry to hear that I know you were

you were excited you were feeling

hopeful for change and I don't get that

same sense from you right now in fact it

seems like you're feeling pretty sad and

maybe even a little hopeless yeah about

the situation well how can I make how

can I be helpful and supportive and

useful to you right now I just I don't I

don't know how to make change I don't

know how to I don't know how to end this

I don't know how to get out I don't know

how to I just I can't do it anymore

so you've decided to make a change and

in fact it sounds like you've decided to

leave the relationship I don't know I I

mean I want to I don't want to be in it

but I don't I don't know how to get to

not being in it so you're thinking about

it it's not that you've committed or

decided that you absolutely want to

leave the relationship but correct me if

I'm wrong what you're saying is you want

to make a change and you don't want this

relationship as it is

and now what what are you think about

changing what what ideas I mean I guess

you mentioned leaving what other

possibilities or thoughts have you had

about change and what that might look

like I don't know it just feels so

overwhelming when I think about it I

just I can't seem to find a way out of

it and that feels feels ethical it feels

like it and you know I don't want to

hurt her I just don't want to be in this

relationship anymore why don't you want

to be in this relationship anymore it's

not healthy it's I'm not happy I can't

imagine that she's happy even though she

says she is it's you know we're fighting

constantly I feel like I'm walking on

eggshells with her she's overprotective

she yeah it just it doesn't feel right

it just doesn't feel right it doesn't

feel right yeah and so so what would

feel right oh that's a huge question hmm

I just don't I'm not sure just this

isn't right so the way things are is not

right it's not working you don't feel

supported this isn't the kind of

relationship that that you want or that

you had hoped that it would be yeah I

mean when we started it was it was

lovely she is amazing she was just super

caring and thoughtful woman and you know

we were not the same interests you know

same friends it's you know she was just

fantastic and I don't know I don't know

where that changed and I feel like we

did this on again off again stuff and

it's just it just seems like just not

right um I know I know I don't deserve

to be treated this way I know that I'm

I'm better than that

mm-hmm you really value your self and

your well-being and in your spirit and

it sounds like you don't feel like

you're taking good care of yourself by

staying in this relationship and even

though things started out well they

haven't turned out to be the kind of

relationship that you want for yourself

no but you know but she's lovely and I

love her and I can't imagine I can't

imagine my life without her in it so

you're feeling torn yeah you're you're

torn between your love and affection for

her and your sense of honoring yourself

and you've got a lot of mixed feelings

and you are saying that you need

something to change that sounds like

you're able to kind of hold that

complexity if you will that you've got

these strong feelings for this person

and you don't feel like this is the a

good relationship for you no I think

it's good for either one of us mm-hmm

for both of you yeah well so so then

you've talked a little bit about leaving

I mean tell me more about what you've

thought about and when you think about

making a change in terms of leaving what

what might that look like for you I

don't know I mean it feels I just can't

imagine my life without her in it so the

idea of not having her there feels

really scary and the idea of staying the

way it is and things not changing feels

even scarier so I don't I don't know how

to and I don't even know how I would do

that our lives are so intertwined I mean

my business our friends our the queer

community is so small you know that's my

fam those are as much as my friends

that's my family as well and so just you

know how do you how do you extract

yourself from that in a way you know for

me like in a way that I feel I'm doing

that with grace and

respect for her and respect for myself

what what thoughts do you have about how

you do that how do you extract yourself

how might you extract yourself in a way

that has some integrity and grace as you

said I don't I don't even know I mean

talk to my friend Jay about it and I

don't know he suggested like a break but

I don't I don't know I just don't want

to get caught in that on-again-off-again

before like you know like we've done

before and but the idea of a break feels

a little less I don't know maybe more

gentle mm-hmm I don't know say more a

little more gentle

I don't know how to give us both time to

really think about it and and I don't

know maybe maybe she'll change maybe

maybe if I'm you know if this is it if

this is it like if this break is it

maybe maybe she'll be able to change

mm-hmm I heard you say that live you

know moving on and having a life without

Kelly is really scary in fact it's

almost impossible for you to imagine

what that would look like especially

with the way that your lives are so

intertwined I also heard you say that

the thought of not making a change is

scarier and I was wondering if you could

say a little bit more about what you

mean by that it's just I feel exhausted

I feel like I'm not I'm not who I was

when I came into this relationship I

feel like I'm constantly struggling to

make her happy and that just doesn't

work there's nothing I can do and I feel

like I've lost my joy mm-hmm

and I don't know I'm just afraid of what

will happen if I just keep staying in a

place where I feel like I'm falling

apart mm-hmm my piece yeah so you're

concerned about your own well-being in

your own joy and your your spirit if you

you stay and don't make this change and

that's the part that's really scary for

you yeah you mentioned that your friend

suggested possibly taking a little break

and you said that that was a scary

thought for you and I guess I'd like to

hear more additional thoughts you might

have about that as a as an option for

you

well I did it seems like I mean if it

could happen if we could find a way to

make it happen that it would be it would

just give me some time to think about

like what I want and what I need and and

you know I feel like I can't sort out

what's me in this anymore

mm-hmm and and so like if I had that

space just to sort of breathe and not

have to worry about her feelings and

taking care of her and just being able

to focus on myself for a little while I

don't know it seems like that would be

helpful it sounds like you're feeling

like you're so in in it just so in the

the mixed emotions and the sense of

hopelessness and sadness and

disappointment that it's really hard for

you to see out of it and an advantage a

reason to take a break would be just to

give you a moment to breathe and look

around and collect yourself and not be

so stuck in that ambivalence if you will

that sense of not knowing yeah well if

you don't mind I'd love to ask you to

take a look at this ruler here I just

kind of wrote this down really quickly

but on a scale of zero to ten zero being

not motivated at all and ten being

extremely motivated how motivated would

you say you are to take a break in your

relationship right now oh like six six

so somewhat motivated yeah why is six

and not a one because I know it needs I

need it I feel like I'm losing myself so

I feel like it's important yeah well so

so why a six and not a nine or ten

because I'm not sure how to make it

happen mmm yeah I don't I don't know so

it's important to you and you're not

maybe fully

confident or sure about how the how part

yeah how to make it well kind of

following up on that on a scale of zero

to ten zero being not confident at all

ten being extremely confident how

confident are you that if you decided to

take a break from your relationship with

Kelly you would be successful at making

that happen

oh I don't know maybe like a three or

four okay so so less confident or a

little less confident than you are

motivated why a three and not a zero

because I I'm on it I mean I do it's

something I want mm-hmm and so wanting

it makes you feel confident that you

confident to some extent that you could

actually make it happen

yeah why a three and not an eight or a

nine I can't control her I don't know

how she would react and I just don't

want any more arguments and anger and

yeah and I don't want to hurt her so so

when you think about taking this break

you're also thinking about how shy she

might respond and what she might do and

that creates a whole other kind of set

of worries yeah it undermines your sense

of confidence on some level it creates a

lot of anxiety for me yeah what do you

think needs to be different in order for

you to feel more confident about

successfully being able to take a brief

break I think and like maybe a plan like

just knowing knowing what the rules are

sort of like where where where I want to

go with it and and what I'm whole I

don't know what I want to accomplish so

thinking through an actual plan like

what you would say how long what the

boundaries are might might help you yeah

that regard okay and then one final

question on a scale of zero to ten zero

being not ready at all and ten being

extremely ready how ready would you say

you are to commit to taking some kind

brief break and that let's say the next

couple of weeks yeah so so pretty ready

yeah and and you've spoken to this

already a little bit I believe but I'll

ask you again why and eight and not a

one or two because I know if I just let

it drag out that I'm gonna be miserable

so your sense of readiness is actually

really connected to your motivation that

is that this is something you know that

you need to do for yourself and if you

don't things are not going to get any

better and that that makes you both

motivated and even more ready well why

why an eighth and not a ten that's you

know it's scary and change is hard and

thinking about not being with the woman

I thought I was going to marry that's

that makes me sad so your emotions your

sense of maybe sadness and in grief and

disappointment around this detract from

your sense of readiness and in some way

sort of given up on a dream yeah and so

another aspect of enter your whole

experiences that your your grieving the

really should should be isn't even over

yet but your grieving the dream and the

hopes that you had and that's a that's a

heaviness and that's certainly a factor

and and what you do next well if I could

take just a moment and make sure I've

captured and understood everything

you've shared with me and I I know this

is really difficult to talk about so I

really appreciate you spending the time

to share with me with what this has been

like for you you've been feeling stuck

and things were great for a while you

had some hope that things were gonna

change and now you were realizing that

Kelly is not going to change and that

you were suffering in the process that

you are really being kept from your

aspirations in your dreams

in a lot of different regards you know

that you need to make a change you want

to make a change

and you have a lot of mixed feelings

about this change you know it's what you

want to do it's the right thing for you

and you still really care and love Kelly

and you're also concerned kind of on an

outer level about your business about

your community about your family and

your friends and how they may be

affected by a breakup in order to make

this more manageable you're thinking

maybe in terms of smaller change like

taking a small break as opposed to

breaking off the relationship and you

feel like you're pretty ready you're

somewhat you know you're motivated and

it may be a little less confident but

you also said that if you were able to

maybe think through a concrete plan that

that might help you feel more confident

yeah and that's certainly something that

we could do together next time we meet

if that's all right with you I'd be

happy to hear your ideas maybe even

share some suggestions with you about a

possible plan that'd be alright yeah

yeah thank you thank you very much for

your time Liv I really appreciate it

you

this is your worker calling back I got

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,799
your voicemail so we do actually have

81
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,750
some funds available right now before we

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,830
can release them however

83
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,450
do need a quote from your doctor and

84
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,329
writing what what do you mean well we

85
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,829
have the funds on your sense we can't

86
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,238
help out with the package because it is

87
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,370
related to your disability uh-huh but

88
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,900
before we release at extra money we need

89
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,910
the exact value from the doctor on file

90
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,440
here so if you're able to get your

91
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,000
doctor to send us a copy of the fee see

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,170
them and then we'll be able to release

93
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,030
those funds to you and it usually takes

94
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,980
about five to seven business days to

95
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,540
release the funds once we have all the

96
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,940
paperwork sorted out I don't understand

97
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,800
this is such a complicated process and

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,870
by the time it's done I'm probably not

99
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,550
going to get into the next cycle at the

100
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,340
at the hospital I am sorry about that

101
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,710
okay all right I I understand that

102
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,750
you're trying to help but ok ok goodbye

that they would be willing to give the

107
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,920
funds for the medical package but they

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,050
need a quote sent to them for how much

109
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,470

110
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,960

hi this is Joanna Dean calling and I'm a

patient of dr. Bob and I need to come in

to get a medical package filled out so I

can attend a program your Joanna yet we

actually got your package in the facts

earlier today so we can set up an

appointment for you now before we set

the appointment I did just one let you

know though that this package isn't

covered by OHIP so you will have to pay

for it it and it's generally about a

hundred and $125 for this hospital a

hundred or 125 dollars roughly yeah okay

I don't have that money because I'm on

ODSP for my depression and so I haven't

actually been working okay well

sometimes some local municipalities do

have extra finals for people that are on

Oh Deus Pere owo help some of these

programs okay my recognitions call your

worker ya see what they can do for you

and call us back if they're able to help

out and then we can go from there okay

I'll call my worker right now okay hey

day thank you goodbye hi you've reached

caseworker for 3672 i'm currently away

from my desk the moment but if you leave

me your name the message I will get back

to you within the next 48 hours thank

you and have a good day right okay hi

this is Joanna Dean calling I am calling

because I I really need to get this

medical package done and it turns out it

costs money and I've been told that

maybe you can help me out with the fee

so that would need to go to my doctor

it's a hundred dollars or 125 dollars i

can't remember and I need to get it

filled out so I can go to a program to

help me with my depression please please

call me back bye hello hi may I speak to

Joe and please yes this is Joanna hi

this is your worker calling back I got

your voicemail so we do actually have

some funds available right now before we

can release them however

do need a quote from your doctor and

writing what what do you mean well we

have the funds on your sense we can't

help out with the package because it is

related to your disability uh-huh but

before we release at extra money we need

the exact value from the doctor on file

here so if you're able to get your

doctor to send us a copy of the fee see

them and then we'll be able to release

those funds to you and it usually takes

about five to seven business days to

release the funds once we have all the

paperwork sorted out I don't understand

this is such a complicated process and

by the time it's done I'm probably not

going to get into the next cycle at the

at the hospital I am sorry about that

okay all right I I understand that

you're trying to help but ok ok goodbye

dr. Bob's office reception speaking hi

this is Joanna Dean calling um I I did

speak with my ODSP worker and they said

that they would be willing to give the

funds for the medical package but they

need a quote sent to them for how much

it's going to be so could you do that

please I'm glad they're able to help you

out with the package cost so before we

can do the quote we just need you to

come in there like a brief 15 minute if

I'm with a doctor just we can scan it

and see which forms we are going to have

to do for you and that will let them

know if it's going to be the 100 or 125

so we do have something not today but if

something in two days around on the

Friday about ten in the morning are you

able to come in at that time um this is

so complicated I'm I well I actually

have a really hard time with mornings

because of my medications that I'm on so

it makes it hard to sleep it makes it

hard to get up to um okay well let's see

we can find something ya later in the

day we don't have anything that friday

if we go into the following tuesday we

can get you something around we have a

1230 otherwise we're looking towards the

end of next week for late afternoons but

we do have a 1230 on Tuesday would you

be able to do that one okay yes I'll

take that one okay so we'll see you in

12 30 on tuesday okay thank you but

I

week has looked like for you

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,680
this week um i don't know i guess it was

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,280
a little bit more productive

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,280
than usual but not really i'm still just

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,600
usual dead to the world

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
i'm dead to the world yeah you know i'm

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,520
just

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,119
in my room most of the day i'm not

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,359
really part of the world or

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,640
part of my family i'm just closed off

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,320
in my own little sad universe i guess

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,280
so you're feeling isolated from your

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
family

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,840
yeah yeah i'm just feeling really

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,719
disconnected just really

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,600
i don't know it's just been a really

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
tough week with my husband

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,600
we've been fighting a lot as usual

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,840
so when you say you're feeling um

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,559
disconnected

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
can you explain to me more what that

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,080
looks like

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,119
yeah i guess um i'm just

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
i'm so tired all day i'm just exhausted

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,640
and

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,159
he has all these demands and all these

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,680
things he wants me to do and

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
i just feel like i'm not capable of

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
doing that i can't even get myself out

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
of bed in the morning

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,720
how am i supposed to do all the things

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
he wants me to do like

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
just last night he came home yelling at

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,080
me like usual

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,720
and all the dishes were still in the

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,280
sink

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
and all the the laundry was all in the

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,759
bed

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,840
i like i couldn't even tell them that

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,159
like i looked online for jobs

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,759
which i always thought i should be proud

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
of but anyway i don't know i didn't even

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,720
find a job so

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,399
whatever it wasn't that big of a deal

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
but i just thought maybe

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,159
like we could talk about that but it was

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,000
just feeling that

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
shirts need to be ironed and

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
i just couldn't do any of it

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
so you feel that even though

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
you made some progress by looking at

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,719
them for jobs this week

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,239
that you didn't feel much accomplishment

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,000
from that because your husband didn't

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
acknowledge it or appreciate it

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
yeah he doesn't appreciate anything

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
again

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
how does being unappreciated make you

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
feel inside

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
it just makes my whole body just ache

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
just makes me feel empty like

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
if he can't appreciate the things that i

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
do then why would i be motivated to do

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
the things that he wants me to do like

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
how am i supposed to

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
iron his shirts when i can't even get

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,480
out of bed in the morning

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
you know it just makes me feel really

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
just

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,879
just empty and just miserable

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,800
i hear you saying that you're shutting

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,519
down and not only do i hear you saying

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,120
that like i can see

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,519
you sitting here with me with the way

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,800
you're sitting with your arms crossed

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
like i feel like you're

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
closing yourself off to a lot of things

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,640
to a lot of people

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,159
yeah yeah definitely i

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,319
am because they don't notice anything i

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,360
do

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
and i mean it's on monday like i i

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,599
actually got out of the house which i

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
thought was like

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,239
a big deal in the moment but

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,400
i took the cat to the grammar my

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
husband's been bugging me about that for

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,640
months and

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
you know i got out of the house i drove

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
the groomers i changed

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
my pajamas and like all these things are

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,239
a big deal to me but he doesn't even see

94
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,920
that it's an accomplishment

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
they didn't even notice like my daughter

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
didn't notice either she just comes home

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,319
and slams the door

98
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
doesn't even look at me the cat was all

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
groomed i have a nice little bow no one

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,959
even

101
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
it's been like five days since that and

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
no one's even said anything

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
since then so i feel

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
i feel like i've made this huge

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
accomplishment for myself

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,400
by getting out of the door even and

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,959
taking

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,000
the cat to the groomers

109

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,959
noticed by anyone

111
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,239

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
so for things to matter to you and for

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,320
you to feel good about the

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,358
even little practice steps you're making

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,199
you really need to have that

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
acknowledged by your husband and your

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,320
daughter

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,840

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
you know if i don't have that support

122
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,600
all i do is point out the things i

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
haven't done like i'll do something that

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
it's all about what hasn't been done oh

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
you haven't vacuumed

126
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
in two months but they don't notice the

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
things that i

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
actually do so i feel

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
i hear you saying that you're

130
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,800

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
so bethany you're feeling all the skirt

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,360

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
nobody's recognizing who you are you

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
laundry vacuuming to do all these chores

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
it's a lot do you think there's a way to

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
maybe

138
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
put it away somewhere for a little bit

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
to be able to address other issues

140
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
try okay um

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
do you try to put in a little jar and be

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,639
able to call that hurt

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
you know jotter

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,840
it's hard it's like there's so much of

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
it it won't fit

146
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
yeah oh maybe do you need a bigger space

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
maybe for it

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
yeah all right let's check me in the

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
corner over here

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
let's try it one more time

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
it's hard it's like it won't disconnect

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
from me i just

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,600
i can't separate it from myself

154
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
okay um what do you think that hurts

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
trying to tell you

156
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
i don't know

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,960
let's take a minute think about it

158
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
you need something like maybe

159
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
it's just telling me that this is what i

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
always do i always try to avoid it

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,160
okay well

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
let's let's tell the hurt that the hurt

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,160
is important

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,759
and we'll be able to come back to it

165
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
once you push it away

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
so it's not going to be there forever so

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
can you do that

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,479
yeah i guess we could try i just know

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,479
it's it's trying to tell me that

170
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,720
it's not going to work it's just

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
yeah i feel like it's just what i always

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
do with it i was just trying to avoid it

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,880
okay all right well let's try doing this

174
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
let's try closing your eyes

175
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
we'll do some breathing exercises here

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,360
take a deep breath breath

177
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,560
in deep breath out

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,560
deep breath in deep breath out

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,919
imagine all the laundry your husband

180
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,120
daughter

181
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
the cat let's put it outside in the

182
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,639
hallway

183
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,160
the very bottom of the hallway

184
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,840
breathe in

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
a little bit more relaxed but i still

186
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
don't feel good

187
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
okay well is it in the hallway are you

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
still hanging on to it

189
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,720
i guess it's in the hallway just

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,759
different things

191
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,880
kind of coming up okay so

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
what are you what what are you feeling

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,599
what you want to talk about

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
oh no i get some kind of loss what

195
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
should i talk about

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
i don't have an agenda today so whatever

197
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,479
whatever comes to mind

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
whatever you feel is important

199
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,120
i don't know what i mean

200
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
we'll take a minute we'll think about it

201
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,560
close your eyes again

202
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,400
think about what you're feeling

203
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
so what are you feeling right now

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
i guess what it really is is i feel

205
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
guilty

206
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,679
like even letting go of that hurt

207
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,320
i need that hurt or like that hurt makes

208
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,839
me feel guilty

209
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,120
so you feel guilty when you hurt i'm not

210
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,959
not worthy of feeling hurt

211
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,320
not worthy of feeling good yeah

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
exactly it's like i feel guilty

213
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
for even feeling hurt but i feel guilty

214
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
for feeling good it's like

215
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
i don't deserve happiness but i know i

216
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
probably deserve to feel better

217
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
it's just no matter what i just feel

218
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
guilty

219
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
so i want to i want to kind of delve

220
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,680
into that a little bit

221
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
that you'll get your feeling that's

222
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
arising into this herb would you be

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
willing to try something with me

224
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
okay so what we're going to do

225
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
is i want you to think about this

226
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,760
chair and i want you to picture yourself

227
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,279
over here

228
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,959
this is the side of you that says you

229
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
don't deserve to be able to feel guilty

230
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
and that you don't deserve to be hurt so

231
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
i want you to

232
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
focus on yourself okay um

233
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
tell yourself about how it makes you

234
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,480
feel

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,200
to be guilty

236
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,880
i just feel like i i feel guilty for

237
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
hurting because it makes me

238
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,560
it forces me to just stay in bed and

239
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,760
it makes me feel hurt makes me feel like

240
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
i'm incapable of taking care of my

241
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
family

242
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
and i need to take care of my family

243
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
and i just feel guilty because while i'm

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
hurting i can't do that i can't either

245
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,839
the clothes down when i'm hurt

246
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
um

247
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
you don't deserve to be feel guilty

248
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,640
about being hurt

249
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,720
you don't deserve to feel guilty about

250
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,920
being hurt

251
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,480
you need to take care of your family and

252
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
stop being so selfish

253
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
you need to stop being so selfish your

254
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
family needs you

255
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,079
you take care of them and when you

256
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,600
don't take care of them they

257
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,360
get upset

258
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
that's why they're always mad at you

259
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,560
because you don't take care of them

260
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,279
you're selfish

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
how does it make you feel who yourself

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,279
tells you that you're selfish

263
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,680
it hurts it's really sad

264
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
and sad it makes me it hurts me

265
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
it hurts me and you tell me i'm selfish

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
and you tell me i'm not there for my

267
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,040
family that i don't care about things i

268
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
do care about them so much

269
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,279
i'm trying my best

270
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,560
why are you making me feel guilty

271
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,920
about being hurt i

272
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,079
i have needs too i have needs i

273
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,040
need to be taken care

274
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
to feel good you're not allowing me to

275
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
feel good

276
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,279
how does it feel when you hear

277
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,639
that the the hurt

278
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,200
and the pain

279
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
it just feels like anything

280
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,480
and then you tell yourself i'm selfish

281
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,880
how does that feel inside

282
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,360
it's just really confusing like i

283
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,040
need to break out of this guilty feeling

284
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
i just allow myself to hurt i deserve to

285
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,320
hurt

286
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,920
i i need to hurt sometimes and it's okay

287
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,800
i need to hurt sometimes

288
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,079
i deserve to have my needs

289
00:13:52,079 --> 00:14:03,839
met as well

290
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,920
so how does it make you feel

291
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,000
that your other self understands

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,240
does

293
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,279
i mean i'm still hurting but it's almost

294
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,920

guilty about it

303
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,720
that way i can be there for them and

304
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,000
they can really understand

305
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,040
i mean i need those two yeah

306
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,079
so how do you feel inside

307
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,440
um right now

308
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
i almost feel things feel

309
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
lighter like some of that guilt is gone

310
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,199
even

311
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
i'm still really hurt and i feel really

312
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
sad but

313
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,880
it just feels more okay if you feel that

314
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,040
way

315
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,720
when you hear that you need

316
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
things and it's okay to be hurt

317
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,920
and i need to be validated

318
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,199
without feeling guilty and i can feel

319
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
okay about hurting

320
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
and i can talk about hurting without it

321
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
without feeling guilty about it

322
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,120
and it doesn't make me selfish

323
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
so now

324
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,199
you can come to an agreement with

325
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,279
yourself to

326
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,720
allow that space to hurt

327
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,639
without the guilt yeah

328
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279

um and then we'll pick up again

333
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
next week

","so bethany can you tell me what this

week has looked like for you

this week um i don't know i guess it was

a little bit more productive

than usual but not really i'm still just

usual dead to the world

i'm dead to the world yeah you know i'm

just

in my room most of the day i'm not

really part of the world or

part of my family i'm just closed off

in my own little sad universe i guess

so you're feeling isolated from your

family

yeah yeah i'm just feeling really

disconnected just really

i don't know it's just been a really

tough week with my husband

we've been fighting a lot as usual

so when you say you're feeling um

disconnected

can you explain to me more what that

looks like

yeah i guess um i'm just

i'm so tired all day i'm just exhausted

and

he has all these demands and all these

things he wants me to do and

i just feel like i'm not capable of

doing that i can't even get myself out

of bed in the morning

how am i supposed to do all the things

he wants me to do like

just last night he came home yelling at

me like usual

and all the dishes were still in the

sink

and all the the laundry was all in the

bed

i like i couldn't even tell them that

like i looked online for jobs

which i always thought i should be proud

of but anyway i don't know i didn't even

find a job so

whatever it wasn't that big of a deal

but i just thought maybe

like we could talk about that but it was

just feeling that

shirts need to be ironed and

i just couldn't do any of it

so you feel that even though

you made some progress by looking at

them for jobs this week

that you didn't feel much accomplishment

from that because your husband didn't

acknowledge it or appreciate it

yeah he doesn't appreciate anything

again

how does being unappreciated make you

feel inside

it just makes my whole body just ache

just makes me feel empty like

if he can't appreciate the things that i

do then why would i be motivated to do

the things that he wants me to do like

how am i supposed to

iron his shirts when i can't even get

out of bed in the morning

you know it just makes me feel really

just

just empty and just miserable

i hear you saying that you're shutting

down and not only do i hear you saying

that like i can see

you sitting here with me with the way

you're sitting with your arms crossed

like i feel like you're

closing yourself off to a lot of things

to a lot of people

yeah yeah definitely i

am because they don't notice anything i

do

and i mean it's on monday like i i

actually got out of the house which i

thought was like

a big deal in the moment but

i took the cat to the grammar my

husband's been bugging me about that for

months and

you know i got out of the house i drove

the groomers i changed

my pajamas and like all these things are

a big deal to me but he doesn't even see

that it's an accomplishment

they didn't even notice like my daughter

didn't notice either she just comes home

and slams the door

doesn't even look at me the cat was all

groomed i have a nice little bow no one

even

it's been like five days since that and

no one's even said anything

since then so i feel

i feel like i've made this huge

accomplishment for myself

by getting out of the door even and

taking

the cat to the groomers

then when i get home and it's not

noticed by anyone

it takes it all away it doesn't even

matter to me

exactly exactly

so for things to matter to you and for

you to feel good about the

even little practice steps you're making

you really need to have that

acknowledged by your husband and your

daughter

yeah i mean otherwise what's the point

you know if i don't have that support

all i do is point out the things i

haven't done like i'll do something that

it's all about what hasn't been done oh

you haven't vacuumed

in two months but they don't notice the

things that i

actually do so i feel

i hear you saying that you're

experiencing a lot of hurt

so bethany you're feeling all the skirt

you're feeling

nobody's recognizing who you are you

have all this

laundry vacuuming to do all these chores

it's a lot do you think there's a way to

maybe

put it away somewhere for a little bit

to be able to address other issues

try okay um

do you try to put in a little jar and be

able to call that hurt

you know jotter

it's hard it's like there's so much of

it it won't fit

yeah oh maybe do you need a bigger space

maybe for it

yeah all right let's check me in the

corner over here

let's try it one more time

it's hard it's like it won't disconnect

from me i just

i can't separate it from myself

okay um what do you think that hurts

trying to tell you

i don't know

let's take a minute think about it

you need something like maybe

it's just telling me that this is what i

always do i always try to avoid it

okay well

let's let's tell the hurt that the hurt

is important

and we'll be able to come back to it

once you push it away

so it's not going to be there forever so

can you do that

yeah i guess we could try i just know

it's it's trying to tell me that

it's not going to work it's just

yeah i feel like it's just what i always

do with it i was just trying to avoid it

okay all right well let's try doing this

let's try closing your eyes

we'll do some breathing exercises here

take a deep breath breath

in deep breath out

deep breath in deep breath out

imagine all the laundry your husband

daughter

the cat let's put it outside in the

hallway

the very bottom of the hallway

breathe in

a little bit more relaxed but i still

don't feel good

okay well is it in the hallway are you

still hanging on to it

i guess it's in the hallway just

different things

kind of coming up okay so

what are you what what are you feeling

what you want to talk about

oh no i get some kind of loss what

should i talk about

i don't have an agenda today so whatever

whatever comes to mind

whatever you feel is important

i don't know what i mean

we'll take a minute we'll think about it

close your eyes again

think about what you're feeling

so what are you feeling right now

i guess what it really is is i feel

guilty

like even letting go of that hurt

i need that hurt or like that hurt makes

me feel guilty

so you feel guilty when you hurt i'm not

not worthy of feeling hurt

not worthy of feeling good yeah

exactly it's like i feel guilty

for even feeling hurt but i feel guilty

for feeling good it's like

i don't deserve happiness but i know i

probably deserve to feel better

it's just no matter what i just feel

guilty

so i want to i want to kind of delve

into that a little bit

that you'll get your feeling that's

arising into this herb would you be

willing to try something with me

okay so what we're going to do

is i want you to think about this

chair and i want you to picture yourself

over here

this is the side of you that says you

don't deserve to be able to feel guilty

and that you don't deserve to be hurt so

i want you to

focus on yourself okay um

tell yourself about how it makes you

feel

to be guilty

i just feel like i i feel guilty for

hurting because it makes me

it forces me to just stay in bed and

it makes me feel hurt makes me feel like

i'm incapable of taking care of my

family

and i need to take care of my family

and i just feel guilty because while i'm

hurting i can't do that i can't either

the clothes down when i'm hurt

um

you don't deserve to be feel guilty

about being hurt

you don't deserve to feel guilty about

being hurt

you need to take care of your family and

stop being so selfish

you need to stop being so selfish your

family needs you

you take care of them and when you

don't take care of them they

get upset

that's why they're always mad at you

because you don't take care of them

you're selfish

how does it make you feel who yourself

tells you that you're selfish

it hurts it's really sad

and sad it makes me it hurts me

it hurts me and you tell me i'm selfish

and you tell me i'm not there for my

family that i don't care about things i

do care about them so much

i'm trying my best

why are you making me feel guilty

about being hurt i

i have needs too i have needs i

need to be taken care

to feel good you're not allowing me to

feel good

how does it feel when you hear

that the the hurt

and the pain

it just feels like anything

and then you tell yourself i'm selfish

how does that feel inside

it's just really confusing like i

need to break out of this guilty feeling

i just allow myself to hurt i deserve to

hurt

i i need to hurt sometimes and it's okay

i need to hurt sometimes

i deserve to have my needs

met as well

so how does it make you feel

that your other self understands

does

i mean i'm still hurting but it's almost

like it's okay to hurt me

i feel i feel better that you're

allowing me to hurt

i feel better

i feel validated

i need to help my family i need to hurt

and

show them that i'm hurting but not feel

guilty about it

that way i can be there for them and

they can really understand

i mean i need those two yeah

so how do you feel inside

um right now

i almost feel things feel

lighter like some of that guilt is gone

even

i'm still really hurt and i feel really

sad but

it just feels more okay if you feel that

way

when you hear that you need

things and it's okay to be hurt

and i need to be validated

without feeling guilty and i can feel

okay about hurting

and i can talk about hurting without it

without feeling guilty about it

and it doesn't make me selfish

so now

you can come to an agreement with

yourself to

allow that space to hurt

without the guilt yeah

so we're we're actually out of time for

today

so i want you to

take this awareness with you this week

um and then we'll pick up again

next week
